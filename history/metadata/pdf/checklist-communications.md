COVID-19 General Checklist 
for Communications Infrastructure Employers   
July 2, 2020 
This checklist is intended to help communications infrastructure employers implement their plan to 
prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace and is supplemental to the Guidance for 
Communications Infrastructure Employers. This checklist is a summary and contains shorthand for 
some parts of the guidance; familiarize yourself with the guidance before using this checklist. 
Contents of Written Workplace Specific Plan 
 The person(s) responsible for implementing the plan.  
 A risk assessment and the measures that will be taken to prevent spread of the 
virus. 
 Use of face coverings, in accordance with the CDPH guidance. 
 Training and communication with employees and employee representatives on 
the plan. 
 A process to check for compliance and to document and correct deficiencies. 
 A process to investigate COVID-cases, alert the local health department, and 
identify and isolate close workplace contacts and infected workers. 
 Update the plan as necessary to prevent further cases. 
 Protocols for when the workplace has an outbreak in accordance with CDPH 
guidance. 
 Incorporate COVID-19 preparation into emergency response plans; have 
worksite-specific emergency plans to operate safely during emergencies.     
Topics for Worker Training 
 Information on COVID-19, preventing spread, and who is especially vulnerable.  
 Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks using 
CDC guidelines. 
 The importance of not coming to work if workers have symptoms of COVID-19 as 
described by the CDC, such as a cough, fever, difficulty breathing, chills, muscle 
pain, headache, sore throat, recent loss of taste or smell, congestion or runny 
nose, nausea or vomiting, or diarrhea, or if they or someone they had contact

 The importance of hand washing. 
 The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time. 
 Proper use of cloth face covers, including information in the CDPH guidance. 
 Information on leave benefits, including the Families First Coronavirus Response 
Act and workers’ compensation benefits under the Governor’s Executive Order N-
62-20 while that Order is in effect. 
 Train any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers in these 
policies and ensure they have necessary PPE. 
Individual Control Measures & Screening 
 Symptom screenings and/or temperature checks. 
 Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to stay 
home. 
 Encourage frequent handwashing and use of hand sanitizer. 
 Provide and ensure workers use PPE, such as eye protection and gloves. 
 Provide disposable gloves to workers as a supplement to frequent hand washing 
for tasks such as handling commonly touched items or conducting symptom 
screening. 
 Restrict non-employees entering facilities and conduct temperature and/or 
symptom screening.  
 Equip crews and field technicians with supplies and required protective 
equipment.  
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
 Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas.  
 Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces. 
 Clean and sanitize shared equipment between each use. 
 Clean touchable surfaces between shifts or between users, whichever is more 
frequent. 
 Avoid sharing phones, office supplies, other work tools, or handheld mobile 
communications equipment wherever possible. 
 Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times.  
 Install hands-free devices, if possible, such as motion sensor sinks and soap 
dispensers. 
 Provide sanitary supplies including hand sanitizer and make sure it is readily 
available to employees.  
 Provide personal hand sanitizer to field staff. 
 Use products approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and train workers on chemical hazards, product 
instructions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements. Follow CDPH 
asthma-safer cleaning methods. 
 Sanitize reusable personal protective equipment at the end of each shift. 
----------------Page (1) Break----------------
 Ensure all water systems are safe to use to minimize risk of Legionnaires’ disease. 
 Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shifts. If 
cleaning is assigned to the worker, they must be compensated for that time.  
 Clean floors using a vacuum with HEPA filter or other methods that do not 
disperse pathogens into the air. 
 Consider upgrades to improve air filtration and ventilation. 
 Modify offerings in any on-site cafeterias or dining rooms, including using 
prepackaged foods, and non-touch options for drink, condiment, and flatware 
dispensing. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
 Implement measures to physically separate workers by at least six feet using 
measures such as physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored 
tape, or signs to indicate to where workers should stand). 
 Develop a process workflow with questions and talking points for workers to use at 
the customer’s door to identify suspected COVID-19 concerns. 
 Allow field staff to call a “safety stop” when they are reluctant to enter a dwelling. 
 Contact customers before visits to confirm appointments and check if there are 
infected people on premises, check again when workers are at the door. 
 Use remote diagnostics and self-install/repair strategies wherever possible. 
 Adjust meetings to ensure physical distancing. 
 Utilize work practices, when feasible, to limit the number of workers on site at one 
time. 
 Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to 
maintain physical distancing protocols.  
 Reconfigure, restrict or close breakrooms and create alternative space for breaks 
where physical distancing is possible. 
 Provide separate, designated entrances and exits. 
 Reassign lockers or limit or stagger locker use to increase distance between 
workers. 
 Use remote work arrangements when feasible.  
 Take extra precautions for field workers operating in a restricted area or 
containment zone.

Additional Considerations for 
Telecommunications 
 Conduct daily safety briefings. 
 For work performed at healthcare facilities or other higher risk locations, arrange 
cleaning and physical distancing in advance. 
 Segregate crews on shift work schedules. 
 Use a dedicated entrance door that opens automatically. 
 Outside visitors should not be allowed in control centers. 
 Consider which personnel can perform their jobs in spaces adjacent to an existing 
control room. 
 Consider control room functions that can be performed remotely. 
 Control center support staff (e.g., engineering, transmission scheduling, 
compliance, etc.) should be allowed to work remotely to the extent permissible. 
 Where control center personnel are not in the same room, maintain open 
communication between workers. 
 Workstations should allow for at least six feet of space between employees. 
 Conduct temperature and/or symptom screening for contractors. 
 Develop contingency plans to house operators onsite, including bedding, 
hygiene facilities, entertainment, and food accommodations.
