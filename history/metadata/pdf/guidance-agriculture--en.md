OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at 
home to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that 
may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with 
serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are 
at higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely 
when people are in close contact in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, 
even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available 
at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating 
that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of 
these workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken 
to ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible, 
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not 
required) and customers/clients, 
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, 
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention 
plan. 
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for the agriculture and livestock industry to support 
a safe, clean environment for workers. The guidance is not intended to revoke or 
repeal any worker rights, either statutory, regulatory or collectively bargained, and is 
not exhaustive, as it does not include county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any 
existing safety and health-related regulatory requirements such as those of 
Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public health guidance and state/local 
orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has more safety and health 
guidance on their Cal/OSHA COVID-19 Infection Prevention for Agriculture webpage. 
CDC has additional information on their guidance for businesses and employers.

Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or
distribution to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance;
•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When
no passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering 
requirements in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful 
workplace. Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for 
the reasonable cost of obtaining them. 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one 
of the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot 
wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if 
feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude 
any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying 
with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these 
exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Workplace Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at 
every facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas 
and work tasks, and designate a person at each facility to implement 
the plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
facility is located, for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the workplace for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as 
needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace 
has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) 
and close contacts. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in 
workplace illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed 
or limited. 
Topics for Worker Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to 
contracting the virus. 
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks 
using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work: 
o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC,

such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty 
breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of 
taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea, OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR 
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone 
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered 
potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
o To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only 
if 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their 
symptoms have improved, and the worker has had no fevers 
(without the use of fever reducing medications) for the last 72 
hours. A worker without symptoms who was diagnosed with COVID-
19 can return to work only if 10 days have passed since the date of 
the first positive COVID-19 test. 
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, 
including scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer 
with at least 60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product 
is inaccessible to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a 
sink or handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time 
(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do 
not replace the need for physical distancing and frequent 
handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or 
discarded after each shift.

• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, 
and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face 
coverings. Training should also include the employer’s policies on how 
people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will be 
handled. 
• Ensure any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at 
the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and 
have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of 
time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to 
receive that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See 
additional information on government programs  supporting sick leave 
and worker’s compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave 
rights under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and workers’ 
rights to workers’ compensation benefits and presumption of the work-
relatedness of COVID-19 pursuant to the Governor’s Executive Order N-
62-20 while that Order is in effect. 
Individual Control Measures and 
Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers 
entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom 
screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible. 
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative 
to providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was 
performed prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows 
CDC guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section 
above. 
• Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to 
stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful 
to supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples 
are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling 
commonly touched items.

Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas such as break rooms, 
lunch areas, and changing areas and areas of ingress and egress such 
as handrails. Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces including 
steering wheels, doorknobs, toilets, and handwashing facilities. 
• Clean touchable surfaces between shifts or between users, whichever 
is more frequent, including but not limited to working surfaces, tools, 
handles and latches, and controls on stationary and mobile 
equipment. 
• Ensure delivery vehicles and equipment are cleaned before and after 
delivery routes and carry additional disinfection materials during 
deliveries. 
• Avoid sharing phones, other work tools, or equipment wherever 
possible. Never share PPE. Shared equipment like tools and machinery 
must be disinfected prior to and at the conclusion of use to mitigate 
transmission. 
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their 
shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as 
part of the worker’s job duties. Procure options for third-party cleaning 
companies to assist with the increased cleaning demand, as needed. 
• Ensure sanitary facilities, restrooms, and handwashing stations with soap, 
water, paper towels, and hand sanitizer are provided at all sites and 
workplaces. Ensure that these facilities stay operational and stocked at all 
times and provide additional supplies when needed. Provide additional 
sanitary facilities (portable toilets and handwashing stations) if necessary. 
• Stagger breaks if feasible to ensure physical distancing and the 
chance to clean restrooms frequently. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use products 
approved for use against COVID-19 included on the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. 
Use disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral 
pathogens, diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per 
gallon of water), or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are 
appropriate for the surface. Provide workers training on the chemical 
hazards, manufacturer’s directions, ventilation requirements, and 
Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or 
disinfectants should wear gloves as required by the product instructions. 
Follow the asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended by the

California Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation. 
• Continue to follow existing codes regarding requirements for sanitizing 
(rather than disinfecting) food contact surfaces. 
• Workers should inspect deliveries and take all necessary and feasible 
disinfection measures when receiving goods that appear tampered 
with. 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading 
the building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making 
other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and 
ventilation in offices and other spaces. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between workers. These can include use of physical partitions or visual 
cues (e.g., floor markings, colored tape, or signs to indicate to where 
workers should stand). 
• Take measures at checkout stations and other places where physical 
distancing cannot be maintained to minimize exposure between 
cashiers and customers, such as Plexiglas barriers. 
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., 
managing inventory rather than working as a cashier or managing 
administrative needs through telework). 
• Adjust safety meetings to ensure physical distance and use smaller 
individual safety meetings at the workplace to maintain physical 
distancing guidelines. Transition all meetings and interviews to phone or 
digital platforms or hold outside or in a space allowing for at least six 
feet of physical distance between workers. 
• Utilize work practices, when feasible, to limit the number of workers in 
close proximity. This may include scheduling (e.g., staggering shift 
start/end times) or rotating worker access to a designated area during 
a shift. Stage the workplace to stagger work and limit overlap of 
workers. 
• Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas 
to ensure at least six feet of separation to limit transmission of the virus. 
Designate separate entrance and exits and post signage to this effect. 
• Stagger worker breaks, within compliance with wage and hour 
regulations, to maintain physical distancing protocols.

• Close breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance between 
tables/chairs to separate workers and discourage congregating during 
breaks. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade covers 
and seating that ensures physical distancing. 
• Workers should consider bringing a lunch made at home or purchase 
take out or delivery where available. Consider providing individual 
water bottles instead of water containers and cups to prevent 
repeated contact with the dispense nozzle. 
• Use the following hierarchy to prevent transmission of COVID-19 in work 
areas especially where physical distancing is difficult to maintain: 
engineering controls, administrative controls, and PPE. 
o Engineering controls include creating physical or spatial barriers 
between workers such as Plexiglas or other sturdy and impermeable 
partitions. 
o Administrative controls include increasing the number of shifts to 
reduce the number of personnel present at one time and ensure 
adequate physical distancing. 
o PPE includes face shields, some types of masks, and impermeable 
gloves. Note that some disposable equipment such respirators are 
prioritized for health care workers and workers that handle 
pathogens and should not otherwise be used. 
• Designate drop-off locations to receive deliveries away from on-farm 
high traffic areas. Maintain physical distance of at least six feet with 
delivery drivers. Do not shake hands, hug, or use similar greetings that 
break physical distance. Install production transfer-aiding materials, 
such as shelving and bulletin boards, to reduce person-to-person 
production hand-offs. Call recipients ahead when making deliveries. 
Arrange delivery to confirmed drop-off locations that eliminate physical 
contact with recipients.

1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. The agriculture and 
livestock industry must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its 
guidance as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers must be 
prepared to alter their operations as those guidelines change.
