positivity, and local preparedness to 
support a health care surge, vulnerable 
populations, contact tracing, and

OVERVIEW 
As stay-at-home orders are lifted for additional industries to promote California’s 
economic recovery, the need for child care and other supports for working families 
increases.  
The information below will assist you in locating child care, finding assistance to pay for 
child care, and connecting you to additional supports for your family.  
Child Care Availability
•Many child care centers and family child care homes are still open. Visit
https://covid19.ca.gov/childcare/ to view an interactive map of licensed
child care providers near you.  All programs are required to take
additional health and safety precautions and preventive measures.
•Please contact your local child care resource and referral agency or 1-
800-KIDS-793 to find out more about child care availability and child care
subsidies if you need help paying for child care.
•In addition to the state portal and state funding options, employers and
labor unions also have resources, including Carina Care to assist with
child care needs.
Types of Child Care 
•Licensed Family Child Care Homes and Centers
oThe California Department of Social Services, Child Care Licensing
Program supports licensed facilities, family child care homes and child 
care centers, by ensuring they meet established health and safety 
standards through monitoring facilities, providing technical assistance, 
and establishing partnerships. 
oThe California Department of Education (CDE), Early Learning and
Care Division  directly contracts with organizations to provide
subsidized child care programs.  The CDE has issued guidance and is
offering technical assistance to ensure health and safety guidelines
are implemented to keep children, families, and staff safe during the
current emergency.

• Family, Friend, and Neighbor Care (FFN) 
o Individuals who provide care for their own children, and children from 
only one other family. This type of child care does not need a child 
care license and is legally exempt (license-exempt) from licensure. 
More information on FFN care is available here.  
o TrustLine is a powerful resource if you want to hire a nanny or license-
exempt child care provider. All child care providers listed with 
TrustLine have submitted their fingerprints to the California 
Department of Justice and have no disqualifying criminal convictions 
in California.  
 
To check if a provider is registered on TrustLine call 1-800-822-8490 or 
visit http://trustline.org/ 
 
 
Families Receiving State Subsidies 
All families enrolled prior to the Emergency Voucher program have the option 
to return to care.  All currently enrolled families will have the option to stay in 
care, or return to care, before any new essential worker families are enrolled.  
There is no deadline for currently enrolled children to return to care. 
 
 
Supports for Families with High Risk Family 
Members 
Children with family members at home who are at higher risk for more severe 
COVID-19, including individuals over 65 years of age and those with 
compromised immune systems and certain underlying health conditions, are 
encouraged to stay home. You may consider in-home care, see FFN care 
above. Please also see additional support for families listed below on 
resources that may provide financial relief.
