OVERVIEW 
Child care has long been considered an integral part of California’s economy, but the 
COVID-19 public health emergency has brought to light their interdependence. This 
relationship was evidenced by many employers opening temporary child care settings 
to accommodate their workforces within weeks of the health crisis. 
As California shifts into an economic recovery phase, and stay-at-home orders are lifted 
for more businesses and industries, the need for child care will increase accordingly.  
Many child care programs that have been closed will reopen, and eventually, 
temporary employer-sponsored child care settings may transition from emergency care 
to stable, on-going child care operations.  
Employers have been and will continue to be essential partners to the child care 
industry, and their continued investment in family-friendly workplace policies is critical. 
Employers, children, parents, and society can benefit from employer-sponsored child 
care and policies.

Early Intervention and Preventive Care 
Saves Health Care Costs 
Employers juggle multiple challenges including recruiting and retaining a well-trained, 
productive, high quality workforce. During COVID-19, employers are also faced with 
how and when to re-open workplaces to keep employees safe and be responsive to 
their needs in order to ensure continued productivity. As the stay at home orders are 
lifted, employees will require both child care supports and workplace flexibility. Work-life 
balance policies will become even more important as the state moves into different 
phases of COVID response. Suggested family-friendly practices are listed below.

Family-Friendly Practices 
• Grant flexible working time arrangements through work from home 
policies and other measures.  
• Support access to affordable and quality child care to ensure that 
children have access to early learning opportunities to develop the skills 
they need to reach their full potential and parents are supported to focus 
on work during work hours, knowing their children are well cared for. 
o Share information about free child care referrals with employees  
o Survey your employees about their child care needs and offer 
flexibility where needed through supportive policies. 
o Provide employer sponsored child care onsite or contract for spaces 
at nearly child care centers and family child care homes. 
o Offer employees flexible spending accounts, or dependent care 
assistance plans to pay for child care with pre-tax dollars and/or offer 
direct assistance with child care costs. 
o Provide information to your employees about the California Paid 
Family Leave program. 
o Raise awareness among consumers and clients of the importance of 
early childhood development, including through their own social 
media and other channels.  
o Provide donations, discounts, or in-kind supports to child care 
programs in the community. 
• Promote family-friendly policies with suppliers and other business partners. 
• Guarantee access to paid sick leave 
• Establish a goal of six months paid parental leave to ensure parents can 
spend quality time with their children when they need it the most.  
• Guarantee that women are not discriminated against based on 
pregnancy, motherhood or family responsibilities – for example, in relation 
to employment conditions, wages or career opportunities. 
• Enable breastfeeding at work through paid breastfeeding breaks, 
adequate lactation facilities and a supportive breastfeeding 
environment in the workplace.

• Beyond legal compliance, promote good working conditions such as 
wages that reflect the cost of living for families.  
• Encourage positive parenting practices with staff – for example, develop 
training and awareness campaigns to highlight the importance of early 
childhood development and the critical role of parents in supporting 
early learning. 
• Address the specific challenges faced by migrant and seasonal workers, 
such as supporting workers to move with their families, and work with 
governments to support migrant families’ ability to obtain identification 
and other basic services. 
 
Workplace Health and Safety Guidance 
California employers are required to establish and implement an Injury and 
Illness Prevention Program (IIPP) to protect employees from all worksite 
hazards, including infectious diseases.
