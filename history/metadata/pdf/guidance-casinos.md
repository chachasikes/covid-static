OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population.  
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact with an infected person, even if that person does not have any 
symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, warehouses, 
meat processing plants, and grocery stores.  
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public.  
Key prevention practices include:  
✓ physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,  
✓ use of face coverings by employees (where respiratory protection is not 
required) and customers/clients,  
✓ frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, 
✓ training employees on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention 
plan. 
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus.  
 
The State has engaged in consultation with California Native American tribes (tribes) to 
inform the development of these guidelines, which are advisory in nature and are 
intended to assist tribal casinos seeking to develop reopening and/or operating plans 
aligned with public health best practices. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for tribal casinos to support a safe, clean 
environment for workers and members of the public. The State has engaged in 
government-to-government consultation with California Native American tribal 
governments to inform the development of these guidelines, which are intended to 
----------------Page (1) Break----------------
3 
 
assist in formulating tribal casino reopening and/or operating plans that are aligned 
with public health best practices. These guidelines are advisory in nature, as tribal 
governments are responsible for ensuring that tribal casinos are constructed, 
maintained and operated in a manner that adequately protects the public health and 
safety pursuant to 25 CFR § 522.6(b). 
NOTE: The State recommends that tribes that operate or lease hotels, restaurants, 
bars, spas, salons, fitness centers, swimming pools, nightclubs, lounges, retail 
shopping, conventions, indoor and outdoor sporting and entertainment venues, 
etc., should keep those areas closed until each of those types of establishments is 
allowed to resume modified or full operation in neighboring or surrounding 
counties. When the State allows counties to reopen these industries to modified or 
full operation, the State encourages tribes with these establishments to refer to 
the appropriate industry guidance as it becomes available on the COVID-19 
Resilience Roadmap website. The State recommends that all public events or 
concentrated gatherings, including musical or other performances at these 
facilities, be cancelled or postponed. 
This guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any employee rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include tribal 
or county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory guidance such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 The State recommends that tribes 
stay current on changes to public health guidance and state/local orders, as the 
COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has more comprehensive guidance on their 
Cal/OSHA General Guidelines on Protecting Workers from COVID-19 webpage. CDC 
has additional requirements in their guidance for businesses and employers.

Workplace Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every 
facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas, and 
designate a person at each facility to implement the plan.  
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
facility is located, for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among employees. 
• Train and communicate with employees and employee representatives 
on the plan. 
• Regularly evaluate the facility for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as 
needed to prevent further cases. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected employee and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive 
employee(s) and close contacts.  
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may require the temporary limitation or closure of 
operations. 
 
Topics for Employee Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to 
contracting the virus.  
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks 
using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work if employees have symptoms of 
COVID-19 as described by the CDC, such as a frequent cough, fever, 
difficulty breathing, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, recent loss of taste or 
smell, or if they or someone they live with have been diagnosed with 
COVID-19. 
----------------Page (3) Break----------------

• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including 
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible 
to unsupervised children) when employees cannot get to a sink or 
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time 
(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE).   
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not 
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing.  
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Employees should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings.  
o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings should be washed or discarded after each shift.  
• Ensure temporary or contract workers at the facility are also properly 
trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and have necessary supplies and 
PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of time with organizations 
supplying temporary and/or contract workers. 
• Information on employer or government-sponsored leave benefits the 
employee may be entitled to receive that would make it financially 
easier to stay at home. See additional information on government 
programs supporting sick leave and worker’s compensation for COVID-
19, including employee’s sick leave rights under the Families First 
Coronavirus Response Act and employee’s rights to workers’ 
compensation benefits, including, where applicable, the presumption of 
the work-relatedness of COVID-19 pursuant to the Governor’s Executive 
Order N-62-20.

Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers, vendors, 
contractors, and members of the public when entering the 
establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom screener avoids 
close contact with personnel and guests to the extent possible. 
Screeners, workers, and guests should wear face coverings for the 
screening.  
• If requiring employees to self-screen at home, which is an appropriate 
alternative to providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was 
performed prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows 
CDC guidelines, as described in the Topics for Employee Training section 
above. This self-screening does not apply to the members of the public 
who must be screened prior to entry into the facility. 
• Encourage workers and members of the public who are sick or exhibiting 
symptoms of COVID-19 to stay or return home. 
• Employers should provide and ensure workers and members of the public 
use all required protective equipment, including eye protection and 
gloves where necessary.  
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to 
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are 
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly 
touched items. Workers should wear gloves when handling items 
contaminated by body fluids.   
• Face coverings are strongly recommended when employees are in the 
vicinity of others. Workers should have face coverings available and wear 
them when in shared work areas, such as offices and other areas on the 
property. Face coverings must not be shared. Employers are generally 
encouraged to provide face coverings but must provide them when 
required by employer rules or these guidelines. 
• Face coverings are strongly recommended for members of the general 
public. Facilities should have face coverings available for the general 
public and instruct them on the proper use of face coverings. When 
members of the public are entering the facility, workers should provide or 
make available to them clean face coverings, if they did not bring their 
own.  
• Employers should take reasonable measures, including posting signage in 
strategic and highly-visible locations, to remind the public that they 
should use face coverings, practice physical distancing, not to touch 
----------------Page (5) Break----------------

their face, to frequently wash their hands with soap for at least 20 
seconds, and to use hand sanitizer. Employers should take additional 
steps, for example on their website or promotional materials, to inform the 
public of these COVID-19 prevention measures prior to their visit. 
 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas such as lobbies, waiting 
areas, break rooms, and areas of ingress and egress including stairways, 
escalator handrails, and elevator controls. Frequently disinfect commonly 
used surfaces including counters, credit card machines, club terminals, 
touchscreens, armrests, toilets, hand washing facilities, door handles and 
locks, vehicle keys, and display vehicles (steering wheels, door handles, 
seat adjustment controls, radio, etc.). 
• Avoid sharing phones, tablets, office equipment, or tools wherever 
possible. Never share PPE. 
• Regularly clean and disinfect equipment and furniture that must be 
shared between shifts or between users, whichever is more frequent, 
including but not limited to working surfaces, keys, chips in play, gaming 
table rails and chairs, dice and tiles, slot machines and chairs, electronic 
playing book forms, touchscreens, time clocks, cleaning equipment, and 
stationary and mobile equipment controls.  
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their 
shift. Cleaning tasks should be assigned during working hours as part of 
the employee’s job duties.  
• Equip terminals, desks, and help counters with proper sanitation products, 
including hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes, and provide personal hand 
sanitizers to all staff directly assisting customers.  
• Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times 
and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when 
needed.  
• Provide resources to promote employees’ personal hygiene. 
This will include tissues, no-touch trash cans, hand soap, adequate time 
for handwashing, alcohol-based hand sanitizers, disinfectants, and 
disposable towels.   
• When choosing cleaning chemicals, employers should use products 
approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. Use 
disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, 
diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or 
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
8 
 
alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the 
surface. Provide employees training on manufacturer’s directions and 
federal and/or Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers using 
cleaners or disinfectants should wear gloves and other protective 
equipment required by the product instructions. Follow the asthma-safer 
cleaning methods recommended by the California Department of Public 
Health. 
• To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases 
associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and 
features (e.g., drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use 
after a prolonged facility shutdown. 
• Provide hand sanitizer dispensers (touchless wherever possible) 
throughout reception areas, lobbies, gaming tables, restaurant 
entrances, meeting and convention spaces, elevator lobbies, employee 
breakrooms, employee time clock locations, cages (both interior and 
exterior) showrooms, lobbies, and service areas, for use by customers and 
employees.  
• Adjust or modify table or machine operating hours to provide adequate 
time for regular thorough cleaning. 
• Install and encourage the use of credit cards and hands-free devices, if 
possible, including motion sensor lights, contactless payment systems, 
automatic soap and paper towel dispensers, and timecard systems. 
• Inspect deliveries and take all necessary and feasible disinfection 
measures when receiving goods. 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the 
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other 
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in 
offices and other spaces.  
 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between workers and customers. This can include use of physical 
partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored tape, or signs to 
indicate where workers and/or customers should stand) and should be 
used wherever guests form lines or congregate including at check-stands 
and terminals, restrooms, elevator lobbies, host stands and waiting areas, 
valet drop off and pickup, etc.   
• Take measures where physical distancing cannot be maintained to 
minimize exposure between cashiers or other workers and customers, 
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
9 
 
such as Plexiglas or other barriers. Where barriers are not feasible, 
employees must wear face coverings and members of the public are 
highly recommended to wear face coverings. 
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with customers and other employees (e.g., 
managing inventory rather than working as a dealer, server, cashier or 
managing administrative needs through telework)., 
• Display signage at entrances, cage counters, restrooms, ATM machines, 
ticket redemption stations, gaming tables, etc. to remind customers of 
physical distancing, proper use of face coverings and the importance of 
hand hygiene at every opportunity. 
• Where space is limited, reduce the number of people allowed into 
venues to accommodate for appropriate physical distancing. 
• Adjust meetings to ensure physical distance and use smaller individual 
meetings at facilities to maintain physical distancing guidelines. 
• Decrease the capacity for meeting rooms in order to maintain at least six 
feet of physical distance between employees.  
• Close breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance between 
tables/chairs to separate workers and discourage congregating during 
breaks. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade coverings 
and seating that ensures physical distancing. 
• Reconfigure office spaces, gaming tables, casino cages, meeting rooms, 
etc., to ensure workspaces allow for six feet between employees and 
guests.  
• Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas 
like supply rooms, to ensure at least six feet of separation to limit 
transmission of the virus. 
• Stagger employee breaks, in compliance with wage and hour 
regulations, to maintain physical distancing protocols.  
• Close self-service coffee, water, and snack areas, unless guests and 
employees are capable of dispensing without physical touching. 
• Provide a single, clearly designated entrance and separate exit to help 
maintain physical distancing, wherever possible. 
• Ask vendors who are required to enter your locations to have their 
employees follow the guidance of tribal, local, state, and federal 
governments regarding face covering use.

Additional Guidance for Interactions with 
Members of the Public 
•Place hand sanitizing stations in all high traffic areas and other areas 
where queueing and handling of casino chips, cards, money, tickets, etc., 
will occur including but not limited to, machine banks, gaming tables, 
ATM machines, ticket redemption machines, casino cages, restrooms, 
etc. Sanitizing stations should be monitored and maintained as needed.
•When members of the public and employees pass items back and forth 
for an extended period of time (such as cards or chips), ensure frequent 
use of hand sanitizer and remind members of the public (with signs
and/or verbally) not to touch their eyes, nose, and mouth. Consider 
providing disposable gloves at each table for use by members of the 
public. Provide a means of disposal at each location where gloves or 
other materials are provided.
•Provide time between dealer rotations to allow for thorough hand 
washing.
•Cards should be changed upon every dealer rotation, disposed of by the 
outgoing dealer, and replaced with new cards.
•All chips should be washed and disinfected prior to circulation. Chips 
should be removed from service and replaced with clean chips upon 
every dealer rotation.
•Remove tables, chairs, machines, gaming tables, etc., from guest areas 
so that six feet of physical distance can be maintained for customers and 
employees wherever possible. If such items cannot be moved, use visual 
cues to show that they are not available for use or install Plexiglas or other 
types of impermeable physical barriers to minimize exposure between 
customers.
•Reduce the number of occupants at gaming tables and machines so 
that guests have increased physical distance. Where six feet of distance 
cannot be created, employees and members of the public must use face 
coverings. Install impermeable barriers if feasible. Discontinue non-player 
game watching that increases the chance of guests breaking physical 
distance of six feet.
•Discontinue meal service at gaming tables. Staff should take and deliver 
drink orders to customers to limit the number of people moving around 
shared spaces. When serving drinks at tables with guests from different
----------------Page (9) Break----------------

households, providing beverages in disposable, lidded containers is 
recommended.  
• Provide resources to promote personal hygiene of members of the public. 
This will include tissues, no-touch trash cans, hand soap, adequate 
locations for handwashing, alcohol-based hand sanitizers, disinfectants, 
and disposable towels.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1 The State has issued additional requirements for vulnerable populations. The State encourages 
tribes to comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and guidance as well as guidance from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public 
Health (CDPH). Additionally, the State encourages tribal employers to be prepared to alter their 
operations as those guidelines change.
