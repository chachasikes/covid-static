Consistent with the July 20, 2020 announcement of the California Interscholastic 
Federation, this document provides guidance for all youth sports programs—including 
school-based, club, and recreational programs—to support a safe environment for 
players, coaches and trainers, families, spectators, event/program/facility managers, 
workers, and volunteers. For further guidance related to school settings, please see 
this updated guidance for schools and school-based programs. 
NOTE: The risk of transmitting the COVID-19 virus depends on several factors germane to 
sports, including: 
• Number of people in a location 
• Type of location (indoor versus outdoor) 
• Distance between people 
• Length of time at a location 
• Physical contact between people 
• Touching of shared objects 
• Use of face coverings 
• Mixing of people from locations with different levels of community transmission 
As general guidance, smaller groups are safer than larger; outdoor locations are safer 
than indoor; sports that can ensure distance of six feet or more are safer than close 
contact; and shorter duration is safer than longer. Leagues, coaches, parents, and 
athletes need to consider all these factors as they plan to return to play. 
• Outdoor and indoor sporting events, assemblies, and other activities that 
require close contact or that would promote congregating are not permitted 
at this time. For example, tournaments, events, or competitions, regardless of 
whether teams are from the same school or from different schools, counties, or 
states are not permitted at this time. 
• Youth sports and physical education are permitted only when the following can 
be maintained: (1) physical distancing of at least six feet; and (2) a stable 
cohort, such as a class, that limits the risks of transmission (see CDC Guidance 
on Schools and Cohorting). Activities should take place outside to the 
maximum extent practicable. 
• For sports that cannot be conducted with sufficient distancing or cohorting, 
only physical conditioning and training is permitted and ONLY where physical 
distancing can be maintained. Conditioning and training should focus on 
individual skill-building (e.g., running drills and body weight resistance training) 
and should take place outside, where practicable. Indoor physical 
conditioning and training is allowed only in counties where gyms and fitness 
centers are allowed to operate indoors.

• Avoid equipment sharing, and if unavoidable, clean and disinfect shared 
equipment between use by different people to reduce the risk of COVID-19 
spread. 
• Consistent with guidance for gyms and fitness facilities, cloth face coverings 
must be worn during indoor physical conditioning and training or physical 
education classes (except when showering). Activities that require heavy 
exertion should be conducted outside in a physically distanced manner without 
face coverings. Activities conducted inside should be those that do not require 
heavy exertion and can be done with a face covering. Players should take a 
break from exercise if any difficulty in breathing is noted and should change 
their mask or face covering if it becomes wet and sticks to the player’s face 
and obstructs breathing. Masks that restrict airflow under heavy exertion (such 
as N-95 masks) are not advised for exercise. 
• Youth sports programs and schools should provide information to parents or 
guardians regarding this and related guidance, along with the safety measures 
that will be in place in these settings with which parents or guardians must 
comply.
