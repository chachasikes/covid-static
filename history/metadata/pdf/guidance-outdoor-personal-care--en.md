COVID-19 
INDUSTRY 
GUIDANCE: 
Expanded Personal 
Care Services 
Provided Outdoors 
July 29, 2020 
All guidance should be implemented 
only with county health officer approval 
following their review of local 
epidemiological data including cases 
per 100,000 population, rate of test 
positivity, and local preparedness to 
support a health care surge, vulnerable 
populations, contact tracing, and 
testing.

OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at 
home to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that 
may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with 
serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are 
at higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely 
when people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected 
person, even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed 
symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available 
at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating 
that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of 
these workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken 
to ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not
required) and customers/clients,
frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus.  
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for expanded personal care services that are 
permitted to be offered outdoors, which includes personal care that requires touching 
a client’s face, e.g. facials, and waxing. This guidance applies to esthetic, skin care, 
cosmetology, nail services, and massage therapy (in non-healthcare settings). 
Electrology, tattooing, and piercing services must not be provided in the outdoor 
setting because they are invasive procedures that require a controlled hygienic 
environment to be performed safely.  
This guidance is intended to support a safe, clean environment for workers and 
customers. Establishment license holders must acknowledge that renters or lessees 
----------------Page (1) Break----------------
should only resume operations when they are ready and able to implement the 
necessary safety measures to provide for their safety and that of their customers. The 
guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory, or collectively bargained and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA or the California Board of 
Barbering and Cosmetology.1 Stay current on changes to public health guidance and 
state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has more 
comprehensive guidance on their Cal/OSHA General Guidelines on Protecting 
Workers from COVID-19 webpage. CDC has additional requirements in their guidance 
for businesses and employers. 
Outdoor operations may be conducted under a tent, canopy, or other sun
shelter as long as no more than one side is closed, allowing sufficient outdoor
air movement.
Salons should not perform a service that would require a customer to have to
enter the establishment.
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure.  
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
Interacting in-person, indoor or outdoor, with any member of the public;
Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or
distribution to others;
Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance; or,
Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When
no passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
----------------Page (2) Break----------------
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering 
requirements in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful 
workplace. Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers 
for the reasonable cost of obtaining them.  
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one 
of the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot 
wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if 
feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude 
any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying 
with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these 
exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers. 
----------------Page (3) Break----------------
 
 
Workplace Specific Plan 
 Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every 
location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and 
work tasks, and designate a person at each facility to implement the plan. 
 Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
 Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
facility is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers or customers. 
 Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
 Regularly evaluate the workplace for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
 Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related factors 
could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as needed to 
prevent further cases. 
 Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has 
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
 Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) and 
close contacts. 
 Establish an effective heat illness prevention plan with written procedures. 
See the Cal/OSHA heat illness prevention page for resources, including 
FAQs, a webinar, and a sample written plan. Elements of a heat illness 
prevent plan include: 
o Access to water 
o Access to shade  
o Cool down breaks 
o Emergency procedures for heat illness cases 
o Monitoring of employees who are acclimatizing during a heat wave 
o Training on heat illness prevention and symptoms 
 
 Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
 
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
 
 
Topics for Worker Training 
 Information  on COVID-19,  how  to  prevent  it  from  spreading,  and  which 
underlying  health  conditions  may  make  individuals  more  susceptible  to 
contracting the virus. 
 Self-screening  at  home,  including  temperature  and/or  symptom checks 
using CDC guidelines. 
 The importance of not coming to work: 
o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, such 
as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, 
fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, 
sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, 
OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR  
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone 
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered potentially 
infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
 To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 10 
days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms have 
improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of fever 
reducing medications) for the last 72 hours.  A worker without symptoms 
who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only if 10 days have 
passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 test.  
 To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
 The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including 
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible 
to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or 
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
 The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time (see 
Physical Distancing section below). 
 Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
----------------Page (5) Break----------------
 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not 
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or 
discarded after each shift. 
 Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and 
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. 
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who 
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled. 
 Heat illness symptoms and prevention following Cal/OSHA requirements.  
 Ensure any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at 
the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and 
have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of 
time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers. 
 Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive 
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional 
information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers’ 
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under 
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act  and workers’ rights to workers’ 
compensation benefits and presumption of the work-relatedness of 
COVID-19 pursuant to the Governor’s Executive Order N-62-20 while that 
Order is in effect. 
 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
 Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors or contractors entering the 
establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom screener avoids close 
contact with workers to the extent possible.  
 If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to 
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed 
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC 
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. 
 Encourage workers and customers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of 
COVID-19 to stay home. 
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
 
 Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection, gloves, and face shields where 
necessary. 
 Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to 
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are 
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly 
touched items. Workers should wear gloves when handling items 
contaminated by body fluids. 
 Disposable gloves should be worn for services that require them. Wearing 
gloves should be done in conjunction with regular hand washing and is not 
a substitute for regular hand washing. 
 Contact customers before visits to confirm appointments and ask if they or 
someone in their household is exhibiting any COVID-19 symptoms. If the 
customer answers in the affirmative, reschedule the appointment. Such 
communication can be done via phone, app, email, or text to remind 
customers that they should only come to the facility for their appointment 
if they do not pose a health risk to other customers or workers. In order to 
implement pre-screening protocols and ensure physical distancing 
protocols, consider suspending walk-in appointment availability. 
 Tell customers that no additional friends or family will be permitted in the 
work area, except for a parent or guardian accompanying a minor. 
 Customers should be temperature and/or symptom screened upon arrival. 
Be prepared to cancel or reschedule customers who indicate they have 
any signs of illness. 
 Display a set of guidelines for customers that are to be a condition of 
service. The guidelines must include instructions to wear face coverings, 
use hand sanitizer, maintain physical distance from other customers, and 
they should communicate changes to service offerings. The guidelines 
should be posted in clearly visible locations, including at entrances, 
include pictograms, and be made available digitally (e.g. through email). 
 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
 Ensure that coworkers, fellow tenants, booth renters, and/or staff have 
coordinated and put a plan in place for cleaning and disinfection at the 
beginning and end of each shift and in between customers. Perform 
thorough cleaning in high traffic areas, such as reception areas, and areas 
of ingress and egress including stairways, stairwells, and handrails. 
 Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces including credit card 
terminals, counters, reception area seating, door handles, light switches, 
phones, toilets, and handwashing facilities. 
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
 
 Evaluate existing hygiene and sanitation protocols and cleaning processes 
and update where necessary. Use hospital grade, Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA)-approved products to clean and disinfect 
anything the client came in contact with, including treatment tables, face 
cradles, stools, bolsters, door knobs, side tables, chairs, etc. Follow the 
product manufacturer’s recommendations for contact time. Use 
disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, 
diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or 
alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the 
surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer’s 
directions for use, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for 
safe use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should wear gloves and 
other protective equipment as required by the product. Follow the 
asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended by the California 
Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation. 
 Since porous surfaces such as chair seats cannot be easily disinfected, 
consider covering with a plastic or disposable liner and cleaning or 
disposing of the liner after each customer. 
 All appliances at work stations and in treatment areas should be properly 
disinfected between each customer. 
o For non-porous implements, such as tweezers or scissors, clean the item 
with hot, soapy water to remove any physical debris. Rinse and dry the 
implement completely. Follow by immersing the implement in an EPA-
registered liquid disinfectant that is labeled as a bactericide, fungicide, 
and virucide for the full contact time as stated by the manufacturer’s 
directions. Items should be removed at the end of contact time, rinsed, and 
dried with a clean paper towel. 
o For electrical implements such as magnifying LED lamps, hot towel 
warmers, and esthetic devices, clean the implement with a spray or 
wipe to remove any physical debris. Follow with an EPA-registered 
disinfectant spray or wipe for the full contact time as noted by the 
manufacturer’s directions. Use caution when using a spray and be sure 
your device is unplugged and do not spray into the motor. For 
electronics such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, 
and ATM machines, remove visible contamination if present. Follow the 
manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. 
Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics. If no manufacturer 
guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol- based wipes or 
sprays containing at least 60% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry 
surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids. 
 To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated 
with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems (e.g., drinking 
fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown. 
----------------Page (8) Break----------------
 
 Where linens are used, even if the customer does not get under them, the 
linens should still be removed and the bed or table properly disinfected. 
Treatment tables must be covered with either clean treatment table 
paper, a clean towel, or a clean sheet after each use. 
 Workers should wear disposable gloves when removing used linens, towels, 
and other draping, including blankets and client draping for each 
treatment. Do not shake the dirty laundry. Place used linens in a lined, 
lidded receptacle positioned outside the treatment space, if possible, to 
minimize the possibility of dispersing virus in the air. Dirty linens should not be 
used again until properly laundered either by a commercial laundering 
service or a laundering process which includes immersion in water of at 
least 160 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 25 minutes. Store all clean linens in 
a clean, covered place. 
 Where possible, do not clean by sweeping or other methods that can 
disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever 
possible. 
 Workers should consider changing their own clothes after each customer 
or wearing scrubs or a clean, launderable or disposable smock, if 
available. 
 Do not use items (e.g., throw pillows, fabric-lined chairs, seat cushions) with 
surfaces that cannot be cleaned properly. Have a hard-surfaced, non-
porous chair or large hard-surfaced or plastic basket for clients to put their 
clothes on or in. 
 Amenities, including magazines, art books, coffee, self-serve stations 
(unless touchless), and other items for customers, should not be provided in 
the outdoor setting.  
 Thoroughly clean any product display areas, including all shelving and 
display cases. Remove and discard any open “test” products and 
discontinue this practice to help reduce contamination. Add signage to 
this area to let customers know it is cleaned and disinfected daily. 
 Encourage the use of credit cards and contactless payment systems. If 
electronic or card payment is not possible, customers should come with 
exact cash payment or check. 
 Consider upgrading to touchless faucets, soap and paper towel 
dispensers, and adding touchless, automatic hand sanitizer dispensers. 
Ensure soap dispensers and paper towel dispensers are regularly filled. 
 Equip reception areas and workstations with proper sanitation products, 
including hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes. 
 Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift. 
Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as part of 
the worker’s job duties. 
----------------Page (9) Break----------------
 
 Workers should avoid sharing phones, tablets, laptops, desks, pens, and 
other work supplies, wherever possible. Never share PPE. 
 Discontinue the use of shared food and beverage equipment in 
breakrooms (including shared coffee brewers). 
 Consider opening treatment room windows, if feasible and within security 
protocols. Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, 
upgrading the building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and 
making other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and 
ventilation in all working areas. 
 In addition to the above cleaning and disinfecting protocols cosmetology 
and barbering businesses must follow the existing California Board of 
Barbering and Cosmetology rules. Additional rules may also apply for 
businesses at the local, county-level. 
 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
 Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between and among workers and customers, except while providing the 
services that require close contact. This can include use of physical 
partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored tape, or signs to 
indicate to where workers and/or customers should stand). 
 Maintain  at  least  six  feet  of  physical  distance  between  each  work  station 
area,  and/or  use  impermeable  barriers  between  work  stations  to  protect 
customers from each other and workers. 
 Stagger appointments to reduce reception congestion and ensure 
adequate time for proper cleaning and disinfection between each 
customer visit. Consider servicing fewer customers each day or expanding 
operating hours to allow for more time between customers and suspending 
walk-in appointments. 
 If possible, implement virtual check-in technology to ensure that workers 
are notified when a customer arrives. Ask customers to wait in a 
designated area outside that permits necessary physical distancing or in 
their cars.  
 Establish an outdoor reception area where customers can check in while 
still following physical distancing guidelines. Take measures at reception 
desks or other areas where physical distancing cannot be maintained to 
minimize exposure between workers and customers, such as Plexiglas or 
other barriers. 
 Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., managing 
inventory or managing administrative needs through telework). 
----------------Page (10) Break----------------
 
 Require workers to avoid handshakes, fist bumps, hugs, or similar greetings 
that break physical distance. 
 Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade covers and 
seating that ensures physical distancing. 
 Adjust any staff meetings to ensure physical distancing. Hold meetings over 
the phone or via webinar for workers wherever possible. 
 
Additional Considerations for Esthetic, Skin 
Care, and Cosmetology Services 
 Workers should wear a face shield for eye protection (with a face 
covering) when they are providing clients treatment on facial or neck 
areas that do not enable the client to wear a face covering. 
 Disposable gloves should be worn throughout the entire esthetic service 
and while performing cleaning and disinfection of all implements and 
surfaces after each client session. 
 Before leaving the outside treatment area, remove and dispose of gloves, 
apply proper hand sanitizer or wash hands with soap and water. 
 Single use applicators must be used and disposed of immediately after use 
in a lined trash bin. The trash bin should have a lid and should be lined with 
a disposable plastic bag. 
 
   Additional Considerations for Nail Services 
 Ask clients to clean hands by use of hand sanitizer before nail services are 
provided. 
 Workers must wear face coverings at all times, or a respirator where 
required.  
 Disposable gloves should be worn throughout  the entire service and while 
performing  cleaning  and disinfection  of  all  implements  and  surfaces  after 
each client. Once cleaning is finished, remove and dispose of gloves and 
apply proper hand sanitizer or wash hands with soap and water. 
 Pedicures done outside shall be limited to portable tubs/bowls and must 
be disinfected with an EPA-registered liquid disinfectant that is labeled as 
a bactericide, fungicide and virucide. Refer to manufacturer's instructions 
on concentration. The disinfection should occur inside the nail salon and 
not in the temporary outdoor setting.   
 Nail salons should use disposable supplies whenever possible. Any non- 
disposable supplies must be fully disinfected between customers 
----------------Page (11) Break----------------
 
according to the California Board of Barbering and Cosmetology 
guidelines. 
 All single use items, such as cardboard files, sand-bands for drills and 
buffers, disposable sandals, toe separators, and applicators, must be used 
once and immediately thrown away in a lined, lidded trash can. 
 To reduce the number of touchpoints, do not provide nail polish displays. In 
the absence of a nail polish display, use a color palette, which is to be 
cleaned and disinfected after each client use. If the nail polish display is 
not removed, nail polishes should be cleaned and disinfected before 
being returned to the display. 
 Consider whether it is feasible to install a plastic partition between the 
worker and client with ample space cut out where hands or feet can be 
slid underneath to conduct the manicure or pedicure. 
 Allow only one manicurist to work at each station and do not allow clients 
to get multiple services at the same time, such as a manicure and 
pedicure. 
 If fans, such as pedestal fans or hard-mounted fans, are used in the outside 
salon, take steps to minimize air from fans blowing directly from one person 
toward another. If fans are disabled or removed, employers should remain 
aware of possible heat hazards and take steps to mitigate them. 
 
Additional Considerations for Massage 
Services (Non-Healthcare Settings) 
 Ask clients to wash their hands before any services are provided. 
 Consider alterations to the treatment table setup to support the required 
cleaning and disinfecting protocols. This could include using disposable 
face cradle covers and/or protecting the table, table warmers, bolsters, 
and other items with washable barriers like pillowcases that can be 
removed and replaced between each client. Barriers are not a substitution 
for the required cleaning and disinfecting protocols. 
 Evaluate whether facial massages or other hands-on work to the face will 
be offered. If providing such services, use non-latex gloves for this part of 
the treatment. Facial massages should not be performed if it requires 
removal of the client’s face covering. 
 Provide any hand treatments as the last part of the service. 
 Workers should wash their hands immediately upon finishing massage 
services. 
 
----------------Page (12) Break----------------
 
Other Considerations for Moving Work 
Outdoors 
 Rewiring and the use of electrical extension cords can increase the 
likelihood of electrical hazards, including fire and electrocution. Ensure that 
outdoor operations comply with Cal/OSHA and all code requirements. See 
Cal/OSHA’s Guide to Electrical Safety for more information. 
 Ensure there are no tripping hazards from cords or other equipment in 
outdoor work areas. 
 Use shade or other skin protection when not under shade. 
 Stop operations, move away from electrical wiring and equipment, and 
seek indoor shelter if there is lightning within 6 miles of your location (see 
the FEMA “30/30 rule”). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1 Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Personal care 
providers must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance 
as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the 
California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers should be prepared to 
alter their operations as those guidelines change.
