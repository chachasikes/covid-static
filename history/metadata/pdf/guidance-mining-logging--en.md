OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at 
home to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that 
may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with 
serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at 
higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when 
people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, 
even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not required)
and customers/clients,
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for the mining and logging industries to support a 
safe, clean environment for workers. The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal 
any worker rights, either statutory, regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not 
exhaustive, as it does not include county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any 
existing safety and health-related regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1
Stay current on changes to public health guidance and state/local orders, as the 
COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has more comprehensive guidance on their 
Cal/OSHA General Guidelines on Protecting Workers from COVID-19 webpage. CDC 
has additional requirements in their guidance for businesses and employers. The Mine 
Safety and Health Administration has information for mine operators and miners.

Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution
to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance;
•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no
passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering requirements 
in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. 
Employer must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the 
reasonable cost of obtaining them. 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one of 
the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot 
wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if 
feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude 
any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying 
with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these 
exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Worksite Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, worksite-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every 
facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and 
work tasks,and designate a person at each facility to implement the 
plan. Consider including information on continuity of business in case of 
disruption to operations due to illness. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
facility is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the workplace for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as 
needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace 
has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 10 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) 
and close contacts. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
Topics for Worker Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to 
contracting the virus. 
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks 
using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work

o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, 
such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty 
breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of 
taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea, OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR 
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone 
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered 
potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 10 
days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms have 
improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of fever 
reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without symptoms 
who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only if 10 days 
have passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 test. 
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including 
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible 
to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or 
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time 
(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not 
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or 
discarded after each shift.

• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, 
and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face 
coverings. Training should also include the employer’s policies on how 
people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will be 
handled. 
• Ensure any independent contractors, temporary or contract workers, 
and volunteers at the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 
prevention policies and have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these 
responsibilities ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary 
and/or contract workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive 
that would make it financially easier to stay home. See additional 
information on programs supporting sick leave and workers’ 
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under 
the Coronavirus Response Act, and workers’ rights to workers’ 
compensation benefits and presumption of the work-relatedness of 
COVID-19 pursuant to the Governor’s Executive order N-62-20 while that 
Order is in effect. 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers 
entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom 
screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible. 
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to 
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed 
prior to the worker leaving home for their shift and follows CDC 
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above 
• Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to 
stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to 
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are 
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling 
commonly touched items.

• Respirators, and not face coverings, must be used to protect against 
airborne contaminants such as silica and asbestos. Employers should 
take steps to inform workers about policies related to the use of proper 
protective equipment. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas such as break areas, 
lunch tables, and areas of ingress and egress including stairways and 
elevator controls. Frequently clean and disinfect surfaces between shifts 
or between users, whichever is more frequent, including but not limited 
to working surfaces, tools, handles and latches, and controls on 
stationary and mobile equipment. 
• Commonly used surfaces must be frequently disinfected including toilets, 
handwashing facilities, equipment and door handles, showers, and the 
cabs of vehicles and machinery. 
• Avoid sharing phones, two-way radios, and other work tools or 
equipment whenever possible. Never share PPE. 
• Ensure sanitary facilities (toilet and handwashing stations with soap, 
water, and paper towels and hand sanitizer provided) are available at all 
jobsites. Ensure that facilities stay operational and stocked at all times 
and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when 
needed. Provide additional sanitary facilities (portable toilets and 
handwashing stations) if necessary. 
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices before and 
after shifts. If cleaning is assigned to the worker, they must be 
compensated for that time. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use product 
approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. Use 
disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, 
diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or 
alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the 
surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, 
manufacturer’s directions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA 
requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should 
wear gloves as required by the product instructions. Follow the asthma-
safer cleaning methods recommended by the California Department of 
Public Health and ensure proper ventilation. 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading trailer

and ventilation system air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and 
making other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and 
ventilation in trailer offices and other spaces. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between workers. 
• Adjust safety and other meetings to ensure physical distance and use 
smaller individual meetings at the jobsite to maintain physicaldistancing 
guidelines. 
• Utilize work practices, when feasible, to limit the number of workers on the 
jobsite at one time, if necessary, to maintain physical distancing. This may 
include scheduling (e.g., staggering shift start/end times) or rotating crew 
access to a designated area during a shift. Limit overlap or intermingling 
of work crews to avoid cross-contamination. 
• Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas, 
where six feet of separation may not be sufficient to limit transmission of 
the virus. This includes personnel carriers, hoists and elevators, and other 
areas of limited space. 
• Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, 
to maintain physical distancing protocols. 
• Stagger team travel to sites and reduce number of workers transported 
at a time to worksites by increasing the number of transport vehicles, to 
maintain physical distancing to the extent possible. 
• Close breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance between 
tables/chairs to separate workers and discourage congregating during 
breaks. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade covers 
and seating that ensures physical distancing. 
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with others (e.g., taking single turns in a confined 
area). 
• Workers should consider bringing a lunch made at home or purchasing 
food before arriving at the site and avoid congregating. 
• Discontinue nonessential travel and encourage distance meetings via 
phone and internet.

1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Employers must 
comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as 
guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California 
Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers must be prepared to alter their 
operations as those guidelines change.
