OVERVIEW 
As stay-at-home orders are lifted for multiple industries to promote California’s 
economic recovery, the need for child care and other supports for working families will 
increase.  Every child care program must have a plan in place to minimize the spread 
of COVID-19 and to ensure the safety of children, providers, and families. As programs 
begin to reopen and other programs transition from emergency child care for essential 
workers to enhanced regular operations, all providers must apply new and updated 
policies and requirements and must update their emergency preparedness plan.  
Social distancing with young children is a challenging effort. However, the 
recommendations set forth aim to keep children and providers safe and healthy, while 
ensuring children are in a nurturing and responsive environment. Parents may also be 
concerned about the safety of returning children back to care. It is important to 
maintain frequent communication with families about the policies and practices 
implemented in programs to keep everyone safe. This ongoing communication will aid 
in supporting young children with this new transition and social and physical distancing 
practice.  
The state recognizes this health crisis is a fluid situation and is coordinating joint efforts 
with state and local agencies to provide support, as well as current information and 
guidance that is responsive to questions and suggestions from providers, families, and 
stakeholders. Child care providers should continue to monitor updated guidelines and 
information posted at https://covid19.ca.gov.  
These guidelines and considerations are based on the best available public health data 
at this time, and the practical realities of managing a child care program; as new data 
and practices emerge, the guidance will be updated. 
The state has provided funding and materials to support child care programs to access 
cleaning supplies and essential protective gear, such as masks. Please contact your 
local child care resource and referral agency to learn more about what resources are 
currently available. 
The California Department of Social Services (CDSS) worked in collaboration with the California 
Department of Education (CDE) to develop this guidance.

The Healthy Schools Act requires that anyone using disinfectants at child care centers 
complete annual California Department of Pesticide Regulation-approved training. 
Online training can be found by going to https://apps.cdpr.ca.gov/schoolipm/. This 
does not apply to family child care homes. 
 
Planning 
• Have plans in place to protect and support staff, children, and their 
family members who are at higher risk for severe illness. 
• Establish plans for sharing information and guidelines with parents and 
caregivers in their preferred language. 
• Train all staff and communicate with families on the following: 
o Enhanced sanitation practices 
o Physical distancing guidelines 
o Proper use, removal, and washing of face coverings 
o Personal hygiene 
o Screening practices 
COVID-19 specific exclusion criteria. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has 
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
 
o Investigate the COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update protocols 
as needed to prevent further cases.  
 
o Update protocols as needed to prevent further cases. See the CDPH 
guidelines, Responding to COVID-19 in the Workplace, which are 
incorporated into this guidance and contain detailed 
recommendations for establishing a plan to identify cases, 
communicate with employees and other exposed persons, and 
conducting and assisting with contact tracing.

Cleaning 
• Introduce fresh outdoor air as much as possible, for example by opening 
windows. When cleaning, air out the space before children arrive; plan to 
do thorough cleaning when children are not present. If using air 
conditioning, use the setting that brings in fresh air. Replace and check 
air filters and filtration systems to ensure optimal air quality.  
• Implement procedures to frequently clean and disinfect all high-touch 
surfaces, such as sink knobs, toilet handles, tables, door handles. (Some 
programs have one designated staff responsible for routinely cleaning, 
sanitizing, and disinfecting the site.)  
• Designate a container for toys that need to be cleaned, sanitized, or 
disinfected before being introduced back into the classroom 
environment.  
• Have multiple toys and manipulatives accessible that are easy to clean 
and disinfect throughout the day or provide individually labeled bins with 
toys and belongings for each child. Toys that may be put in a child’s 
mouth should be cleaned and sanitized. Ensure toys that are difficult to 
clean (e.g. soft toys) are either removed from the classroom or carefully 
monitored for use by individual children only.  
• When choosing cleaning products, use those approved for use against 
COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved list 
“N” and follow product instructions.  
o To reduce the risk of asthma related to disinfecting, programs should 
aim to select disinfectant products on the N list with asthma-safer 
ingredients (hydrogen peroxide, citric acid or lactic acid) as 
recommended by the US EPA Design for Environment program.  
o Avoid products that mix these ingredients with peroxyacetic 
(paracetic) acid, sodium hypochlorite (bleach) or quaternary 
ammonium compounds, which can cause asthma.   
o Use disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral 
pathogens, following label directions for appropriate dilution rates 
and contact times. Provide employees training on the chemical 
hazards, manufacturer’s directions, proper ventilation, on Cal/OSHA 
requirements for safe use and as required by the Healthy Schools Act 
training (for child care centers only). 
o Workers using cleaners or disinfectants must wear gloves, eye 
protection, and other protective equipment as required by the 
product instructions.

----------------Page (4) Break----------------
 
o All products must be kept out of children’s reach. 
 
Hygiene 
• Implement and enforce strict handwashing guidelines for all staff and 
children. Wash hands for 20 seconds with soap, rubbing thoroughly after 
application, and use paper towels (or single use cloth towels) to dry 
hands thoroughly. It may be helpful to sing a 20-second song while 
children wash. 
• Use bathroom time as an opportunity to reinforce healthy habits and 
monitor proper handwashing.  
• Teach children to avoid contact with one’s eyes, nose and mouth, and 
use tissue to wipe their nose and to cough/sneeze inside their elbow. 
Model and practice handwashing before and after eating, after 
coughing or sneezing, after playing outside, and after using the restroom.  
• Discontinue brushing teeth during class.  
• All personal items should be labeled and kept in a separate bag to 
ensure personal items are separate from others.  Personal toys and 
blankets should either be sent home with the family each day or washed 
daily by the provider.  
• Use bedding (sheets, pillows, blankets, sleeping bags) that can be 
washed. Keep each child’s bedding separate, and consider storing in 
individually labeled bins, cubbies, or bags. Cots and mats should be 
labeled for each child. Bedding that touches a child’s skin should be 
cleaned weekly or before use by another child. 
 
Arrival Procedures 
If a parent/caregiver is entering the classroom, ask them to wash their own 
hands and assist in washing the hands of their children before dropping off, 
prior to coming for pick up, and as soon as they get home.  
• Ask parents/caregivers to meet at the facility entryway for pick-up and 
drop-off of children whenever possible and to be as brief as possible.  
• If parents/caregiver must enter, ask them to enter and exit the room one 
person at a time to allow for social and physical distancing. Consider 
asking them to wear face coverings. 
• Ask parents/caregivers to bring their own pens when signing children in 
and out. When that is not possible, collect pens immediately after a single 
use, deposit them in the cleaning area, and provide a sanitized pen.  
6
----------------Page (5) Break----------------
 
• Install hand sanitizers, out of the reach of children, near all entry doors 
and other high traffic areas. 
• Take steps to reduce contact between children and adults, including 
other children’s parents during pick-up/drop-off, classroom visits, 
volunteers. 
• If possible, the same parent/caregiver should drop off and pick up the 
child every day, avoid designating those at high risk.  
• Consider staggering arrival and drop off times.  
• Consider designating a staff member from each class to escort in or out 
of facility (if parent/caregiver are comfortable with this option) and 
signing their child in and out for arrival. 
 
Health Screening 
• Providers must implement screening procedures for all staff and children 
before they enter the facility. Ask all individuals about COVID-19 
symptoms within the last 24 hours and whether anyone in their home has 
had COVID-19 symptoms or a positive test. Exclude anyone who has an 
affirmative response on any of these points.  
• Document/track incidents of possible exposure and notify local health 
officials, staff, and families immediately of any possible case of COVID-19 
while maintaining confidentiality as required by the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA). 
• Conduct visual wellness checks of all children upon arrival and ask health 
questions when concerned.  
• Take children’s temperature each morning with a no-touch thermometer. 
If a thermometer requiring a touch-method (under the tongue or arm, 
forehead, etc.) is the only type available, it should only be used when a 
fever is suspected. Thermometers must be properly cleaned and 
disinfected after each use.  
• Monitor staff and children throughout the day for signs of illness; send 
home children with a fever of 100.4 degrees or higher, cough, or other 
COVID-19 symptoms after isolating from the general room population 
and notify parents. 
• Child care programs must exclude any child, parent, caregiver, or staff 
showing symptoms of COVID-19. Staff should discuss with 
parent/caregiver and refer to the child’s health history form and/or 
emergency card to identify if the child has a history of allergies, which 
would not be a reason to exclude.

----------------Page (6) Break----------------
 
• Establish procedures for safely transporting anyone sick home or to a 
healthcare facility, as appropriate.  
• Advise sick staff members and children not to return until they met CDC 
criteria to discontinue home isolation.  
 
Coronavirus Symptoms 
• Fever 
• Cough 
• Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing 
• Chills 
• Repeated shaking with chills 
• Fatigue 
• Muscle pain 
• Headache 
• Sore throat 
• Congestion or runny nose 
• Nausea or vomiting 
• Diarrhea 
• New loss of taste or smell

Group Size and Staffing 
• Children should remain in groups as small as possible. Should these 
guidelines differ from local health ordinances, follow the stricter 
guidance. 
• It is important to keep the same children and teacher or staff with each 
group and include children from the same family in the same group, to 
the greatest extent possible.  
 
Classroom Space / Physical Distancing 
• Arrange developmentally appropriate activities for smaller group 
activities and rearrange furniture and play spaces to maintain 6 feet of 
separation, when possible.   
• For napping, place cots, cribs, and mats 6 feet apart, with heads in 
opposite directions.  
• Use opportunities to reduce time spend indoors by bringing children 
outside, weather permitting while maintaining physical distancing.  
• Offer more opportunities for individual play.  
• Plan activities that do not require close physical contact between 
multiple children.  
• Stagger indoor and outdoor play and adjust schedules to reduce the 
number of children in the same area.  
• Ensure all outdoor play equipment is cleaned and disinfected between 
use by different groups of children. 
• Develop spacing instructions in both indoor and outdoor spaces that are 
developmentally appropriate and easy for children to understand. 
 
Meal Times 
• Utilize more tables to spread children out or use name cards to ensure 
adequate spacing of children.  
• Practice proper handwashing before and after eating. Use paper goods 
and disposable plastic utensils when possible, following CDC and CDPH 
COVID-19 food handling guidelines.

----------------Page (8) Break----------------
 
• Do not allow children or staff to share or touch each other’s food. 
• Immediately clean and disinfect trays and tables after meals. Avoid 
family- or cafeteria-style meals, ask staff to handle utensils, and keep 
food covered to avoid contamination. 
• Ensure meals are provided in individual portions and are delivered by 
staff wearing gloves. 
• Implement outdoor meal times if space and weather allow.
