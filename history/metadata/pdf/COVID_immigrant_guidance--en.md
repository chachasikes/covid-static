PROTECT YOURSELF & OTHERS:
 
TAKE THE FOLLOWING STEPS TO PROTECT 
YOURSELF AND OTHERS 
Stay 6 feet way from others not in your household 
when you must go out. 
Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds, 
with warm water if available. 
Cough or sneeze into a sleeve or tissue. Wash your 
hands afterwards. 
Clean any surfaces you touch often. 
Protect older adults and those with health 
problems, as they face a higher risk of getting sick. 
Please take extra care if you are over 65 or have a 
chronic health issue. 
Call your health care provide or usual place of 
health care, like a LOCAL CLINIC, or PUBLIC HEALTH 
DEPARTMENT, if you get a fever, cough or shortness 
of breath. 
Please seek immediate care if you have problems 
breathing, like shortness of breath.

UNDERSTANDING PUBLIC CHARGE
 
Some immigrants worry that the public charge rule stops them from receiving government benefits or that 
using those benefits will hurt their ability to get a green card. 
PLEASE REMEMBER 
∙	 NOT all immigrants are subject to a public 
charge determination. 
∙	 Public benefits accepted by family members 
are generally NOT considered under the public 
charge rule. 
∙	 The new rule does NOT change eligibility rules 
for public benefits programs. 
∙	 Only some benefits are considered public 
benefits for purposes of public charge. 
The FEDERAL GOVERNMENT has said that using 
health care services for COVID-19 prevention, 
testing or treatment alone does not make you a 
public charge. 
Medi-Cal care for COVID-19 related testing or 
treatment does NOT count under the public charge 
rule because it is the treatment of an emergency 
medical condition. 
Please don’t let fear stop you from getting 
necessary treatment, as the effects of avoiding 
health care services may be very serious. This will 
help keep you, your family, and your community 
healthy. 
PUBLIC BENEFITS NOT CONSIDERED FOR PUBLIC 
CHARGE 
∙	 Medi-Cal benefits received for the treatment 
of an emergency medical condition. 
∙	 School-based services or benefits. 
∙	 Medi-Cal benefits received by a noncitizen 
under 21 years of age. 
∙	 Medi-Cal benefits received by a woman 
during pregnancy and during the 60-day 
period beginning on the last day of the 
pregnancy. 
∙	 Public health assistance for immunizations 
with respect to immunizable diseases, and 
for testing and treatment of symptoms of 
communicable diseases whether or not such 
symptoms are caused by a communicable 
disease; and many more.

HEALTH CARE 
Information about benefits can change. Please visit the links available below for the latest information and 
application details. 
SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 
∙	 Fever 
∙	 Cough 
∙	 Shortness of breath 
WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE SICK 
∙	 If you have symptoms such as fever, cough or 
shortness of breath, and believe you may have 
been exposed to COVID-19, please CALL your 
health care provider before seeking care. 
∙	 If you don’t have health care coverage, please 
call your usual source of care, like your doctor, 
LOCAL CLINIC or PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. 
∙	 It is important to call before seeking care to 
avoid putting others at risk. Please be sure to 
tell your health care provider about your travel 
history. 
If you have trouble breathing seek care 
IMMEDIATELY. If you need to call 911, tell the 911 
operator you’re experiencing a fever or cough so 
the ambulance provider can prepare to treat you 
safely. 
TREATMENT AND CARE 
∙	 If it is determined you need a COVID-19 test, 
your test will be free. 
∙	 Even if you are undocumented and/or don’t 
have insurance, you can get necessary testing 
and treatment for COVID-19 through Medi-
Cal emergency services, even at a local clinic. 
∙	 Emergency services are free for enrolled Medi-
Cal beneficiaries which includes COVID-19 
testing, evaluation and treatment services. 
∙	 Medi-Cal care for COVID-19 related testing or 
treatment DOES NOT count under the public 
charge rule because it is the treatment of an 
emergency medical condition. 
∙	 The California community-based COVID-19 
TESTING PROGRAM has expanded access to 
COVID-19 screening and testing for high-risk 
people in certain areas of the state. If you 
are in Santa Clara or San Mateo County, or 
within 50 miles of the city of Riverside, or the 
city of Sacramento and want to get tested for 
COVID-19, you can COMPLETE THE SCREENER 
to see if you qualify. You will need internet 
access and a Google account. 
∙	 There is no treatment for COVID-19 currently. 
However, the CDC lists 10 THINGS YOU CAN 
DO IF YOU’RE SICK and taking care of yourself 
at home. Their guidance is also available in 
SPANISH, VIETNAMESE, KOREAN and CHINESE.

SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORT
 
If you are a small business owner who is a non–U.S. citizen and holds a temporary visa, or if you are 
an undocumented immigrant, your eligibility for small business financial assistance will depend on the 
program. Most importantly, we encourage you to work within your community network of business 
contacts to find a business consultant or lender that you can trust to understand your situation and 
carefully walk you through the options that are best for you. Please find a list of resources here. 
SMALL BUSINESS CENTERS 
For all businesses, California supports a network 
of small business centers which provide free or

resiliency strategies. Many offer multiple languages.

small businesses and nonprofits that may not

wealth and immigrant communities).

HOUSING
 
Information about benefits can change. Please visit the links available below to see the latest information 
including application details. 
IF YOU OWN YOUR HOME AND CANNOT PAY 
YOUR MORTGAGE 
Contact your lender immediately, as many banks 
(e.g. Wells Fargo, Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, 
and US Bank) and California credit unions have 
COMMITTED TO DEFER MORTGAGE PAYMENTS for 
workers and families who have lost income and/or 
who need to care for children at home due to the 
coronavirus. 
IF YOU RENT YOUR HOME AND CANNOT PAY RENT 
The State of California is protecting renters. 
EXECUTIVE ORDER N-37-20 PROHIBITS SOME 
EVICTIONS, if the reason is nonpayment of rent 
because you have lost income for some reason 
related to COVID-19 (including having your hours 
reduced, or needing to miss work to care for 
children at home due to school closures). 
∙	 Under the Executive Order, you are still 
required to eventually make up rental 
payments you miss, but you will not be 
evicted for nonpayment of rent until at least 
June. 
∙	 In order to qualify for the eviction protections, 
you MUST notify your landlord in writing 
within 7 days of your nonpayment that you 
cannot pay all or part of your rent due to 
COVID-19. For example, if your rent is due 
April 1st, then by April 8th. 
There may be additional protections in place in 
your county or city of residence. Please be sure to 
check with your local government to determine 
additional protections against eviction and rent 
payment relief. 
Contact your local housing authority or 
CONTINUUM OF CARE CONTACTS to see if you are 
eligible for help to pay for your rent. 
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR HOUSING 
Dial 211 to find housing opportunities in your city 
or county, or learn more on the U.S. Department of 
Housing COVID-19 HOUSING RESOURCES AND FACTS 
page. 
If you are currently homeless, find your local 
homeless CONTINUUM OF CARE CONTACTS or 
read the article: HOW TO GET HELP IF YOU ARE 
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. 
REMEMBER YOUR RIGHTS 
A landlord cannot discriminate against you because 
of your race, citizenship status, or national origin. 
Landlords cannot refuse to rent to you, or 
otherwise discriminate against you, because of 
your source of income, including if you hold a 
housing subsidy that helps you afford rent. This 
includes Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, as 
well as locally funded subsidy programs created by 
cities, counties, and public agencies to address the 
COVID-19 crisis.

COMMUNITY SAFETY
 
IF YOU SEE PEOPLE IN PUBLIC WEARING 
UNIFORMS 
You may see soldiers in uniform giving out food 
or in the streets. These are National Guard, not 
immigration agents, and are here to help us. They 
do not do immigration enforcement. 
You may also see workers from AmeriCorps, 
Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT) 
and other volunteer service groups. These are not 
immigration agents. They are here to help us. 
Governor Newsom’s stay-at-home order is carried 
out by everyday Californians making the choice 
to save lives by staying home except for essential 
needs or to go to work as an essential worker. 
Some local governments may have stay-at-home 
orders that are stricter than California’s order. You 
can call 211 or check with your county to get more 
information about local orders. 
∙	 Local police and sheriffs may check to make 
sure Californians are following these local 
orders. 
∙	 They may ask for personal identification but 
are not supposed to ask you about your 
immigration status. 
If you need immigration help, please review this 
list of IMMIGRATION SERVICES FROM NONPROFIT 
ORGANIZATIONS. They provide different 
immigration services, including free and low cost 
immigration legal services across California.

PROTECTING AGAINST SCAMS 
& BAD INFORMATION 
During this time, you may read or hear things that might not be true. Here are a few tips for getting to 
the truth. 
Depend on trusted sources like public health 
officials and California’s elected leaders, including 
information available at COVID19.CA.GOV 
BAD INFORMATION 
False news travels faster than truth: don’t spread 
rumors. 
∙	 Even if you hear something from family or 
friends, it might be wrong. 
∙	 Check all sources. Don’t share news unless 
you are sure it is true. 
Websites with accurate information include: 
∙	 CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND
 
PREVENTION
 
∙	 CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH 
∙	 California Coronavirus Response website and 
toolkit at COVID19.CA.GOV and 
TOOLKIT.COVID19.CA.GOV 
∙	 Your local health department. FIND YOUR 
COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. 
Don’t buy things that promise a magic cure, test or 
protection from the virus. 
∙	 For more information and to report scams, 
go to the CONSUMER INFORMATION ON 
CORONAVIRUS SCAMS webpage. 
No one is to blame for the COVID-19 outbreak, and 
we must all work together to end the pandemic. 
This is also a good time for a few good neighbor 
reminders: 
∙	 Speak up when you see others being treated 
poorly. 
∙	 Many of us will be affected by COVID-19, 
regardless of our race, ethnicity, gender, age 
or sexual orientation. 
∙	 Be kind to your fellow Californians and 
Americans and treat everyone with respect. 
∙	 Read GOVERNOR NEWSOM’S TWITTER 
STATEMENTS AGAINST XENOPHOBIA targeting
