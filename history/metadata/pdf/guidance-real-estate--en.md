OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at 
home to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that 
may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with 
serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are 
at higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely 
when people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected 
person, even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed 
symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available 
at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating 
that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of 
these workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken 
to ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not
required) and customers/clients,
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention
plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for businesses operating in the real estate industry 
including sales and rentals of single-family, multi-family, apartment, commercial, and 
industrial properties to support a safe, clean environment for workers. The guidance 
is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, regulatory or 
collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include county health 
orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related regulatory 
requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public health 
guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA 
has more comprehensive guidance on their Cal/OSHA General Guidelines on 
Protecting Workers from COVID-19 webpage. CDC has additional requirements in 
their guidance for businesses and employers.

Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or
distribution to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance;
•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When
no passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering 
requirements in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful 
workplace. Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers 
for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one 
of the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot 
wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if 
feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude 
any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying 
with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these 
exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Workplace Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at 
every facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work 
areas and work tasks, and designate a person at each facility to 
implement the plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
facility is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the workplace for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as 
needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a 
workplace has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive 
worker(s) and close contacts. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
Shown Properties Specific Plan 
• Establish a written COVID-19 prevention plan to be followed by agents 
who show properties. Display a set of rules for agents and home viewers 
at the entrance of the property that are to be a condition of entry. The 
rules must include instructions to use face coverings and hand sanitizer. It 
must include instructions to maintain physical distancing and avoid 
touching surfaces of the shown property. The rules or a link to the rules 
should be part of online public and MLS listings. Posted rules should be 
clearly visible and include pictograms. 
• Real estate and rental agents must confirm understanding of the rules

with visitors before showing the property and provide a digital copy of 
the COVID-19 prevention plan to clients, appraisers, inspectors, stagers, 
purchasing agents and contractors and obtain their agreement to 
follow the plan prior to entering the property. 
• Regularly evaluate compliance with the plan and document and correct 
deficiencies identified. 
Topics for Worker Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to 
contracting the virus. 
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks 
using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work: 
o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, 
such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty 
breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of 
taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea, OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR 
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with 
someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is 
considered potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 
10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms 
have improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of 
fever reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without 
symptoms who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only 
if 10 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 
test. 
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including 
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible 
to unsupervised children when workers cannot get to a sink or

handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time 
(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not 
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or discarded 
after each shift. 
• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, 
and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face 
coverings. Training should also include the employer’s policies on how 
people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will be 
handled. 
• Ensure any independent contractors, temporary or contract, and all 
other workers at the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 
prevention policies and have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these 
responsibilities ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary, 
contract, and all other workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to 
receive that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See 
additional information on government programs supporting sick leave 
and worker’s compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave 
rights under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and workers’ 
rights to workers’ compensation benefits and presumption of the work-
relatedness of COVID-19 pursuant to the Governor’s Executive Order N-
62-20 while that Order is in effect.

Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers 
entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom 
screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible. 
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to 
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed 
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC 
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. 
• Encourage workers and customers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms 
of COVID-19 to stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to 
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are 
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly 
touched items. 
• Employers, brokers, and real estate licensees must take reasonable 
measures, including posting signage in strategic and highly-visible 
locations and in reservation confirmations, to remind clients that 
they must use face coverings and practice physical distancing, 
and should to frequently wash their hands with soap for at least 20 
seconds, use hand sanitizer, and not touch their face when viewing 
a property in person. 
• Remind guests in advance to bring a face covering and make 
them available to anyone who arrives without one, if possible. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols for 
Workplaces 
• Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas of offices and other 
shared workspaces (lobbies, meeting rooms, break rooms, etc.) and 
areas of ingress and egress (handrails, stairways, elevator controls, etc.). 
Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces in shared work areas like 
counters, light switches, door handles, etc. 
• Avoid sharing phones, other work supplies, or office equipment wherever

possible. Never share PPE. 
• Where such items must be shared, disinfect with a cleaner appropriate 
for the surface between shifts or uses, whichever is more frequent, 
including the following: shared office equipment, such as copiers, fax 
machines, printers, telephones, keyboards, staplers, staple removers, 
letter openers, surfaces in reception areas, shared work stations, etc. 
• Instruct workers to wipe down and disinfect equipment that passes 
between workers and customers, including clipboards and keys after 
each use. 
• Equip workplace terminals and desks with proper disinfecting products, 
including hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes and provide personal hand 
sanitizers to all workers. 
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices at their 
workplaces during their shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned 
during working hours as part of the worker’s job duties. 
• Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times 
and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when 
needed. 
• Install and encourage the use of hands-free devices, if possible, including 
motion sensor lights and automatic soap and paper towel dispensers. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use products 
approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. Use 
disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, 
diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or 
alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the 
surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, 
manufacturer’s directions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA 
requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should 
wear gloves and other protective equipment as required by the product. 
Follow the asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended by the 
California Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation. 
• Require workers to clean and disinfect personal work areas often and 
supply the necessary cleaning products. 
• Modify hours if necessary, to ensure regular, thorough cleaning of office 
spaces. 
• Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods 
that can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA 
filter wherever possible.

• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the 
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other 
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in 
offices and other spaces. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols for Shown 
Properties 
• Thoroughly clean shown properties and disinfect commonly used 
surfaces including counters, door and cabinet handles, key lock 
boxes, keypads, toilets, sinks, light switches, etc. These surfaces must 
be cleaned and disinfected before and after each showing. Where 
possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that can 
disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter 
wherever possible. 
• During a showing, introduce fresh outside air, for example by opening 
doors/windows, weather permitting, and operating ventilation systems. 
• Instruct workers to wipe down and disinfect equipment that passes 
between workers and customers, including clipboards and keys, after 
each use. 
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices at shown 
properties during their shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned 
during working hours as part of the worker’s job duties. 
• Real estate licensees should ensure shown properties are equipped with 
proper products, including hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes, for use 
by workers and clients as needed. 
• All people entering a property, including agents, brokers, inspectors, and 
clients, must wash hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer 
immediately upon entry and before touring or inspecting the property. 
• Adjust or modify showings to provide adequate time for proper cleaning 
and disinfecting. If the property is currently occupied, ensure adequate 
time to disinfect after occupants leave for showings and before and 
after clients view the property.

Physical Distancing Guidelines for Workplaces 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between workers and customers. This can include use of physical 
partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings or signs to indicate to where 
workers should stand). 
• Utilize work practices, when feasible and necessary, to limit the number of 
workers at the office at one time. This may include scheduling (e.g., 
staggering start/end times), establishing alternating days for on-site 
reporting, returning to the office workspace in phases, or continued use 
of telework when feasible. 
• Redesign office spaces, cubicles, etc. and decrease the capacity for 
conference and meeting rooms to ensure workspaces allow for six feet 
between workers. 
• Designate separate routes for entry and exit into office spaces to help 
maintain social distancing and lessen the instances of people closely 
passing each other, if possible. Establish directional hallways and 
passageways for foot traffic, if possible, to eliminate workers from 
passing by one another. 
• Close or restrict, using barriers, or separating tables/chairs in common 
areas where personnel are likely to congregate and interact, such as 
kitchenettes and break rooms. Discourage workers from congregating in 
high traffic areas such as bathrooms and hallways. Limit the number of 
individuals riding in an elevator and ensure the use of face coverings. 
• Close self-service coffee, water, and snack areas. Provide individual 
water bottles if there is no other suitable potable water source. 
• Stagger worker breaks, within compliance with wage and hour 
regulations, to maintain physical distancing protocols. 
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with clients, prospective purchasers and 
renters, and other workers (e.g., managing inventory rather than 
working as a cashier or managing administrative needs through 
telework). 
• Display signage at entrances and waiting areas to remind people of 
physical distancing, proper hand hygiene, and face covering usage 
at every opportunity. Dedicate staff to direct guests to meeting 
rooms upon entry to office space rather than congregating in 
lobbies or common areas.

• Discontinue nonessential travel and encourage distance meetings via 
phone and internet. 
• Discontinue shared vehicle trips between workers, contractors, clients, 
etc. Each party should travel in their own vehicle to offices, properties, or 
other locations that require in-person activities. 
• Require workers to avoid handshakes and similar greetings that break 
physical distance. 
• Avoid passing transaction materials such as pens, paperwork, and keys 
back and forth between workers and customers. 
• Complete real estate transactions with all related parties digitally if 
feasible. Maintain physical distance when in-person meetings are 
required with escrow agents, loan officers, mortgage brokers, etc. Meet 
in spaces that allow for at least six feet of physical distance, such as 
outside. 
• Eliminate person-to-person contact for delivery of goods to physical 
offices. Avoid touching others’ pens and clipboards. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines for Shown 
Properties 
• Use an appointment or digital sign-in process to control the number of 
people in the house or property. If current occupants are present and/or 
participate during property showings, in accordance with their legal 
rights, they should adhere to the same standards regarding physical 
distancing, proper cleaning and disinfecting protocols, and promote a 
safe environment for all persons present. 
• Utilize virtual tours via digital technologies, social media, etc. in lieu of 
property showings or open houses whenever possible. If virtualtours are 
not feasible, limit the number of people present during showings. When 
a real estate licensee or renter is present, maintain physical distance at 
all times. 
• Real estate licensees or sellers/renters must open doorways or other 
areas of ingress and egress prior to in-person property showings to 
minimize clients touching surfaces. 
• Real estate licensees should remind clients to maintain physical 
distancing during showings and to refrain from touching 
handles, switches, pulls, etc.

• All persons on property for in-person showings should avoid touching 
knobs, faucets, toilets and toilet handles, light switches, garage door 
opener buttons, handles and pulls, alarm system controls, fan pulls, 
remotes, thermostats, switchboxes, gates and gate latches, window 
locks and sashes, pool coverings, and other such items. 
• Prior to and concluding in-person showings, real estate licensees must 
disinfect mobility and safety fixtures on the property such as handrails and 
banisters, door knobs and locks, and any other surfaces that may have 
been touched during the showing. 
• All home inspectors and prospective homebuyers who accompany the 
inspectors must have access to handwashing facilities and/or hand 
sanitizer. 
• All information must be delivered electronically. Discontinue providing 
handouts or other types of promotional or informational materials. 
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. The real estate industry 
must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as 
guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California 
Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers must be prepared to alter their 
operations as those guidelines change.
