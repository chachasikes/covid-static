OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that 
person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, restaurants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not required)
and customers,
frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus.

PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for shopping malls, destination shopping centers, 
and swap meets (referred to collectively as “shopping center operators”) to support a 
safe, clean environment for workers, customers, and the public. Businesses must identify 
and monitor the County Risk Level for the county the business is operating in and make 
required adjustments to their operations: 
•Purple – Widespread – Tier 1: Indoor operations are permitted but must be limited
to 25% capacity. Common areas and food courts must be closed but restaurants
can offer take-out dining. Shopping centers must follow the modifications in this
guidance.
•Red – Substantial – Tier 2: Indoor operations are permitted but must be limited to
50% capacity. Common areas must be closed. Food courts can open but must
operate at 25% capacity or 100 people, whichever is lower. Shopping centers
must follow the modifications in this guidance.
•Orange – Moderate – Tier 3: Indoor operations are permitted at full capacity.
Common areas must be closed. Food courts can open but must operate at 50%
capacity or 200 people, whichever is lower. Shopping centers must follow the
modifications in this guidance.
•Yellow – Minimal – Tier 4: Indoor operations are permitted at full capacity.
Common areas can open. Food courts can open but must operate at 50%
capacity. Shopping centers must follow the modifications in this guidance.
Shopping centers with family entertainment centers, movie theaters, restaurants, bars, 
spas, nail salons, or other personal care services should refer those retail tenants to the 
modifications and guidance that apply to such industries on the Industry Guidance to 
Reduce Risk site. Those entities are responsible for implementing the guidance, but 
shopping center operators should do what they can to encourage such action is taken. 
Shopping center operators must acknowledge that retail tenants and vendors should 
only open when they are ready and able to implement the necessary safety measures 
to provide for the safety of their workers and customers.  
For the most updated information on county status and to see which tier your business is 
operating under, visit Blueprint for a Safer Economy. Please note that local health 
departments can have more restrictive criteria and different closures. Find your county’s 
local information. 
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Cal/OSHA has more safety and 
health guidance on their Cal/OSHA Guidance on Requirements to Protect Workers from 
Coronavirus webpage. CDC has additional guidance for businesses and employers 
and specific guidance for grocery and food retailers. FDA has best practices for retail 
food stores, restaurants, and food pick-up/delivery services.

Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. Complete details, 
including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be found in the 
guidance.  
 
The CDPH Face Covering Guidance is subject to additional updates based on the 
current scientific understanding of transmission of the virus causing COVID-19. Please 
check the CDPH website for any revisions.

Workplace Specific Plan 
•Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every
location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and
work tasks, and designate a person at each establishment to implement
the plan.
•Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions.
•Identify contact information for the local health department where the
operation is located for communicating information about COVID-19
outbreaks among workers or customers.
•Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives.
•Regularly evaluate the establishment for compliance with the plan and
document and correct deficiencies identified.
•Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as
needed to prevent further cases.
•Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines and orders or
guidance from the local health department.
•Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive
worker(s) and close contacts.
•Notify all employees in writing, and employers of subcontracted
employees, who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and report
workplace outbreaks to the local health department. For additional
information on employer responsibilities under AB 685 (Chapter 84, Statutes
of 2020), refer to the Enhanced Enforcement and Employer Reporting
Requirements from Cal/OSHA and the Employer Questions about AB 685
from CDPH. 
•Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited.
Topics for Worker Training 
•Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which
5
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
people are at higher risk for severe illness or death. 
•Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks
using CDC guidelines.
•The importance of not coming to work:
oIf a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC,
such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty
breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of
taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea,
vomiting, or diarrhea, OR
oIf a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been
released from isolation, OR
oIf, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with
someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is
considered potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation).
•To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only after
meeting CDPH Guidance on Returning to Work or School Following
COVID-19 Diagnosis.
•To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face.
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage.
•The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible
to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). Never use hand sanitizers with
methanol due to its high toxicity to both children and adults.
•The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time
(see Physical Distancing section below).
•Proper use of face coverings, including:
oFace coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE).
oFace coverings do not replace the need for physical distancing and
frequent handwashing.
oFace coverings must cover the nose and mouth.
oWorkers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or
adjusting face coverings.
6
----------------Page (5) Break----------------
oAvoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth.
oFace coverings must not be shared and should be washed or
discarded after each shift.
•Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings.
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled.
•Ensure any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at
the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and
have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of
time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers.
•Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional
information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers’
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
•Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the
beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers
entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom
screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible.
•If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above.
•Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to
stay home.
•Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary.
•Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly
touched items.
•Remind guests in advance to bring a face covering, otherwise they
7
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
should not be allowed to enter the premises (unless exempted per the 
CDPH Face Covering Guidance). Consider making face coverings 
available for guests who may arrive without them. 
•Shopping centers must take reasonable measures, including posting
signage in strategic and highly-visible locations, to remind workers, retail
tenants, vendors, and the public that they must use face coverings and
maintain physical distancing.
Ventilation, Cleaning, and Disinfecting 
Protocols 
•Where possible, install portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrade
the building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and make
other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and
ventilation in offices and other indoor spaces.
•Check the CDPH website periodically for updates on indoor air quality
and ventilation guidance for airborne diseases in indoor settings.
•Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas, such as restrooms,
worker break rooms, and entrances and exits, including doors and
door handles, stairways, escalator handrails, and elevator controls.
•Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces, including benches,
counters, ATM PIN pads, registers, water fountains (spout, button/lever,
and nozzle), guardrails, displays, hand-held devices, shelving, customer
assistance call buttons, handwashing and sanitation facilities, mall
seating, touch screens, facility maps, vending machines, etc.
•Regularly clean and disinfect shared equipment between each use,
such as time clocks, radios, and headsets for workers as well as
wheelchairs, strollers, mobilized devices, carts, baskets, or other
equipment frequently used by shoppers.
•Regularly wipe down touchable surfaces, including but not limited to
working surfaces, registers, touchscreens, computer monitors, and
stationary and mobile equipment controls.
•To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases
associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and
features are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown.
•Avoid sharing audio equipment, phones, tablets, laptops, desks, pens,
and other work supplies wherever possible. Never share PPE.
•Discontinue shared use of audio headsets and other equipment between
8
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
workers unless the equipment can be properly disinfected after use. 
Consult equipment manufacturers to determine appropriate disinfection 
steps, particularly for soft, porous surfaces such as foam earmuffs. 
•Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their
shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as
part of the workers’ job duties. Procure options for third-party cleaning
companies to assist with the increased cleaning demand, as needed.
•Equip customer entrances and exits, promenades, and other common- 
space areas with proper sanitation products, including hand sanitizer.
Display signage indicating where the nearest hand sanitizer dispenser is
located. Check hand sanitizer dispensers periodically and refill before
they run out.
•When choosing disinfecting chemicals, use products approved for use
against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-
approved list and follow product instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to
be effective against emerging viral pathogens, diluted household
bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or alcohol solutions
with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the surface. Provide
workers training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer’s directions,
ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use.
Workers using cleaners or disinfectants must wear gloves and other
protective equipment as required by the product instructions. Follow the
asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended by the California
Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation.
•Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times and
provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when needed.
•Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that
can disperse pathogens into the air unless all persons in the area have
appropriate PPE. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever possible.
•Encourage the use of credit cards at retail tenant and vendor locations
and install hands-free devices, if possible, including motion sensor lights,
contactless payment systems, automatic faucets, soap, and paper towel
dispensers, and timecard systems.
•Adjust or modify shopping center hours to provide adequate time for
regular deep cleaning and product stocking.
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
•WARNING: physical distancing alone is insufficient to prevent transmission
of COVID-19.
9
----------------Page (8) Break----------------
•Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet
between and among workers and customers in all shopping center
locations. This can include use of physical partitions or visual cues (e.g.,
floor markings, colored tape, or signs to indicate to where workers and/or
customers should stand).
•Take measures at customer service desks or other areas where physical
distancing cannot be maintained to minimize exposure between workers
and customers, such as Plexiglas or other barriers.
•Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., managing
inventory rather than working as a cashier or managing administrative
needs through telework).
•On-property security staff should actively remind and encourage
customers and the public to comply with the physical distancing
standards.
•Create clearly-marked curbside or outside pickup points, that maintain
physical distance with visual cues or other measures, and have
purchased goods available there or available through home delivery.
•Shopping center operators, retail tenants, and vendors should also
identify additional strategies to increase pickup and delivery service
options for customers to help minimize in-store contact and maintain
physical distancing, such as online ordering and returns-processing from
shoppers’ vehicles with no direct hand-off of items.
•Develop and implement controlled foot traffic and crowd management
strategies that enable at least six feet physical distancing between
customers. This can include requiring foot traffic be one-directional and
guiding customers with visual cues, physical props, and signage. Provide
clearly designated entrances and separate exits, if feasible and
appropriate for the space, to help maintain physical distancing and
support crowd control. Wherever possible, doors should be left open if
they do not open and close automatically. Work with tenants to create
queue systems for customers outside individual stores while still
maintaining physical distance, if necessary.
•Shopping center operators, retail tenants, and vendors should
collaborate to develop store entry queuing systems that do not disrupt
foot traffic or violate physical distancing requirements. Consider and
encourage alternate entry to retail tenant facilities, including digital
reservations for entry and pre-order guidelines.
•Vendor carts or kiosks should only be permitted to operate in shopping
center aisles or walking areas if they do not interfere with updated foot
10
----------------Page (9) Break----------------
traffic measures or inhibit physical distancing requirements. Reconfigure 
vendor carts or kiosks, where necessary, to ensure queuing does not 
impede physical distancing requirements. 
•Open-air shopping centers, such as swap meets, should ensure that
vendors space tables, tents, and other displays are in accordance with
appropriate physical distancing requirements or ensure other
impermeable barriers are in place.
•Shopping center operators should collaborate with retail tenants and
vendors to identify opportunities that make use of unused or
reconfigured real estate for revenue-generating opportunities in
accordance with local regulations and that support physical distancing
requirements. This could include expanding restaurant dining space in
real estate managed by the shopping center operator, e.g.
promenades or modified parking spaces.
•Work with retail tenants and vendors to consider dedicated shopping
hours for vulnerable populations, including seniors and those medically
vulnerable, preferably at a time following a complete cleaning.
•Chairs, seating, benches, and other public spaces should be
reconfigured to enable physical distancing requirements.
•Hold meetings over the phone or via webinar for workers wherever
possible. If not feasible, adjust staff meetings to ensure physical
distancing and use smaller individual meetings at facilities to maintain
physical distancing guidelines. Place additional limitations on the
number of workers in enclosed areas to ensure at least six feet of
separation to limit transmission of the virus.
•Ensure workers can maintain physical distance in breakrooms, using
barriers, increasing distance between tables/chairs to separate workers,
etc. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade coverings and
seating arrangements that ensures physical distancing. Discourage workers
from congregating during breaks and ensure they are not eating or
drinking without face coverings within six feet of each other.
•Implement physical distancing requirements at loading bays and move
to contactless signatures for deliveries.
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Shopping center 
operators must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance 
as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the 
California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers should be prepared to 
alter their operations as those guidelines change.
