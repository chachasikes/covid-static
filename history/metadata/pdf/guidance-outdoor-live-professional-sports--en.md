COVID-19 
INDUSTRY 
GUIDANCE: 
Sporting Events at  
Outdoor Stadiums  
and Racetracks 
October 20, 2020 
This guidance is designed to address 
sectors and activities opening statewide. 
However, local health officers may 
implement more stringent rules tailored 
to local epidemiological conditions, so 
employers should also confirm relevant 
local opening policies.

OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that 
person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, restaurants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
 physical distancing to the maximum extent possible, 
 use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not 
required) and customers, 
 frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, 
 training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention 
plan. 
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus.

PURPOSE 
Professional sports may resume training and competition without live audiences, subject 
to approval by county public health officers. This document provides guidance for the 
outdoor operations of stadiums and racetracks during live, professional sporting events 
to support a safe, clean environment for workers and guests. Businesses must identify 
and monitor the County Risk Level for the county the business is operating in and make 
required adjustments to their operations: 
•Purple – Widespread – Tier 1: No live audience permitted.
•Red – Substantial – Tier 2: No live audience permitted.
•Orange – Moderate – Tier 3: Outdoor operations only are permitted at
permanent and fixed venues (see note below on permissible outdoor venues),
in addition to the following modifications:
oCapacity must be limited to 20% and ticketing must only be available for
reserved seating. Ticket sales must be restricted to customers traveling
within a 120-mile radius.
oTicket sales must include a designated parking space for each ticketholder
group.
oVenues are not permitted to provide will-call or sell tickets on the day of
the event to enable adequate planning for physical distancing within the
venue.
oEating and drinking are permitted in assigned seats only. Concourse
concessions areas must be closed, and all food and drink must be
delivered directly to guests in their seats.
oOperators must follow the modifications in this guidance.
•Yellow – Minimal – Tier 4: Outdoor operations only are permitted at permanent
and fixed venues (see note below on permissible outdoor venues), in addition
to the following modifications:
oCapacity must be limited to 25% and ticketing must only be available for
reserved seating. Ticket sales must be restricted to customers traveling
within a 120-mile radius.
oTicket sales must include a designated parking space for each ticketholder
group.
oVenues are not permitted to provide will-call or sell tickets on the day of
the event to enable adequate planning for physical distancing within the
venue.
oEating and drinking are permitted in assigned seats only. Concourse
concessions areas must be closed, and all food and drink must be
delivered directly to guests in their seats.
oOperators must follow the modifications in this guidance.

Permissible Outdoor Venues: For the purposes of this guidance, a permissible outdoor 
venue for live audience professional sporting events shall require:  
• A permanent and fixed facility, focused around an area of play, designed 
primarily for viewing sports by an audience/spectators. 
• The facility shall either be open to the sky with no roof or have at least 50% of 
the total perimeter open, meaning there are no walls, doors, windows, dividers, 
or other physical barriers that restrict air flow, whether open or closed. There 
must be sufficient natural ventilation and air circulation to dilute and disperse 
concentrations of aerosols effectively without the support of mechanical 
systems. 
• The facility shall be designed in a way that provides operators the ability to 
control fully the flow, ingress, and egress of all visitors, and to separate athletes 
and workers from the general audience. 
• There must be permanent or added barriers to create at least 25’ between 
space occupied by audience members/spectators and the focal point (field 
of play). 
• Audience seating shall be fixed, and readily identifiable to all individual visitors 
by section, row, and seat. 
For the most updated information on county tier status, visit Blueprint for a Safer 
Economy. Please note that local health departments can have more restrictive criteria 
and different closures. Find your county’s local information.  
NOTE: This guidance applies only to professional sports and does not apply to 
recreational, amateur, semi-professional, or collegiate sporting competitions. Those 
sectors are permitted to operate only to the extent that they are addressed in other 
guidance documents. To reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission, athletes, coaching 
staff, medical staff, broadcasting staff and others at sporting facilities or events should 
refer to COVID-19 protocols agreed by labor and management, which may be further 
enhanced by county public health officers. Back office staff and management should 
follow the guidance for office workspaces. Sports venues have a number of 
operational aspects and service offerings which have been covered in prior guidance 
and are available on the Industry Guidance to Reduce Risk website, including:  
• Food service and concessions (Restaurant guidance) 
• Bars (Bars, Breweries, and Distilleries guidance) 
• Gift shops and retail operations (Retail guidance) 
• Hotels and lodging (Hotels, Lodging, and Short-Term Rentals guidance) 
• College, Non-professional, and Amateur Sports (Higher Education guidance) 
• Youth sports (Youth Sports guidance)  
• Outdoor recreation (Campgrounds, RV Parks, and Outdoor Recreation 
guidance) 
4
----------------Page (3) Break----------------
• Trams, shuttles, and other transit (Public and Private Passenger Carriers, Transit, 
and Intercity Passenger Rail guidance) 
o Limit shuttle service whenever possible and in accordance with obligations 
to individuals with disabilities. 
• Maintenance and custodial work services (see Limited Services guidance) 
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to 
public health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. 
Cal/OSHA has more comprehensive guidance on their Cal/OSHA General Guidelines 
on Protecting Workers from COVID-19 webpage. CDC has additional considerations 
for events and gatherings.  
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. Complete details, 
including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be found in the 
guidance. 
The CDPH Face Covering Guidance is subject to additional updates based on the 
current scientific understanding of transmission of the virus causing COVID-19. Please 
check the CDPH website for any revisions.  
5
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
 Workplace Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every 
facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and 
work tasks, and designate a person at each facility to implement the 
plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
facility is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers or guests. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the workplace for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as 
needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has 
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines and orders or 
guidance from the local health department. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) and 
close contacts. 
• Notify all employees in writing, and employers of subcontracted 
employees, who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and report 
workplace outbreaks to the local health department. For additional 
information on employer responsibilities under AB 685 (Chapter 84, 
Statutes of 2020), refer to the Enhanced Enforcement and Employer 
Reporting Requirements from Cal/OSHA and the Employer Questions 
about AB 685 from CDPH. 
• For outdoor operations: Establish an effective heat illness prevention plan 
with written procedures in both English and the language understood by 
the majority of the employees. The plan must be available to employees 
at the worksite. See the Cal/OSHA heat illness prevention page for 
resources, including FAQs, a webinar, and a sample written plan. 
Elements of a heat illness prevent plan must include: 
o Access to potable drinking water 
o Access to shade 
6
----------------Page (5) Break----------------
o Cool down breaks 
o Emergency procedures for heat illness cases 
o High heat procedures when the temperature exceeds 95 degrees 
o Monitoring of employees who are acclimatizing during a heat wave 
o Training on heat illness prevention and symptoms 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
 
Topics for Worker Training 
• To reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission, athletes, coaching staff, 
medical staff, broadcasting staff, and others at sporting facilities or events 
should also refer to COVID-19 protocols agreed to by labor and 
management, which may be further enhanced by local public health 
officers. Back office staff and management should follow the guidance 
for office workspaces. 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
people are at higher risk for severe illness or death.  
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks 
using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work: 
o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, such 
as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, 
fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, 
sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, 
OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR  
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone 
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered 
potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only after 
meeting CDPH Guidance on Returning to Work or School Following 
COVID-19 Diagnosis. 
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
7
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including 
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible 
to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or 
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). Never use hand sanitizers with 
methanol due to its high toxicity to both children and adults. 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time 
(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings do not replace the need for physical distancing and 
frequent handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or 
discarded after each shift. 
• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and 
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. 
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who 
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled. 
• Heat illness symptoms and prevention following Cal/OSHA requirements. 
• Ensure independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at the 
facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and 
have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of 
time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive 
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional 
information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers’ 
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under 
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.

----------------Page (7) Break----------------
 Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Use of face coverings is mandatory throughout the stadium or racetrack 
in all settings, unless actively eating or drinking in assigned seats or 
exempted per the CDPH Face Covering Guidance. Customers who do 
not comply should be removed from the facility immediately.  
• Stadium and racetrack operators must develop a strategy to verify 
contact information with ticket holders. Contact tracing is an important 
step in slowing the spread of COVID-19. 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors or contractors entering the 
establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom screener avoids 
close contact with workers to the extent possible.  
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to 
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed 
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC 
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. 
• Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to 
stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to 
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are 
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly 
touched items. Workers should wear gloves when handling items 
contaminated by body fluids.   
• Workers who consistently must be within six feet of customers or co-
workers (e.g., fitting and securing guests with safety equipment) must 
wear a secondary barrier (e.g. face shield or safety goggles) in addition 
to a face covering. All workers should minimize the amount of time spent 
within six feet of guests. 
• Employers must take reasonable measures, including posting signage at 
entrances, in strategic and highly-visible locations, and in reservation 
confirmations, to remind the public that they must use face coverings 
and practice physical distancing, and that they should frequently wash 
their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, use hand 
sanitizer, and not touch their face. 
• There must be permanent or added barriers to create at least 25 feet 
between space occupied by audience members/spectators and the 
focal point (field of play). 
9
----------------Page (8) Break----------------
• All non-participating athletes, coaching, staff, and other support staff 
must wear a face covering at all times except when eating or drinking. 
• All audience members and stadium attendees must wear a face 
covering at all times except when eating or drinking. Stadium and 
racetrack operators must establish a policy that requires guests to wear 
face coverings or be denied access to the venue if not exempted per 
the CDPH Face Covering Guidance. As part of the policy, remind guests 
in advance to bring a face covering; otherwise they should not be 
allowed to enter the premises. Consider making face coverings available 
for guests who may arrive without them. 
• Guests should be temperature and/or symptom screened upon arrival, 
asked to use hand sanitizer, and directed to bring and wear a face 
covering when not eating or drinking if not exempted per the CDPH Face 
Covering Guidance. Stadium and racetrack operators have the right to 
cancel reservations for individuals/parties with symptomatic guests and 
refuse entry. 
• Display a set of clearly visible rules for guests and workers at entrance(s) 
that are to be a condition of entry. The rules could include instructions to 
wear face coverings at all times, except when eating or drinking in 
assigned seating, if not exempted per the CDPH Face Covering 
Guidance; use hand sanitizer; maintain physical distance from other 
guests and workers; avoid unnecessary touching of surfaces; and 
changes to services.  Whenever possible, the rules should be available 
digitally, e.g. through apps, texts, or email. 
 
Ventilation, Cleaning, and Disinfecting 
Protocols 
• Where possible, install portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrade the 
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and make other 
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation 
offices and other indoor spaces. 
• Check the CDPH website periodically for updates on indoor air quality 
and ventilation guidance for airborne diseases in indoor settings. 
• Perform thorough cleaning in high-traffic areas such as lobbies, break 
and rest areas, merchandising tables and booths, etc., and areas of 
ingress and egress, including stairways, hallways, doorways, and elevator 
banks. Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces, including counters, 
credit card machines, touchscreens, doorknobs, keys, armrests, toilets, 
hand washing facilities, etc. 
• Regularly clean and disinfect surfaces shared by workers between shifts 
or between users, whichever is more frequent, including but not limited 
10
----------------Page (9) Break----------------
to working surfaces, time clocks, copy machines, keys, cleaning 
equipment, flashlights, etc. Avoid sharing equipment such as phones, 
tablets, office machinery, and tools wherever possible. Never share PPE.  
• Disinfect microphones and similar equipment between each use. Consult 
equipment manufacturers to determine appropriate disinfection steps, 
particularly for soft, porous surfaces such as foam mufflers.  
• Disinfect loaned or rented equipment to guests between use. If this is not 
possible, to the extent it is consistent with the facility’s obligations to 
individuals with disabilities, discontinue the use of equipment lent to 
guests.  
• Thoroughly clean and disinfect facilities and equipment after every 
event. This can include disinfecting tables, chairs, booths, touch screens, 
etc. Allow adequate time for proper disinfection, following product 
instructions. Environmental Protection Agency-approved disinfectants 
require a minimum contact time (seconds to minutes) to be effective 
against human coronavirus.  
• Equip terminals, desks, and help counters with proper sanitation 
products, including hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes, and provide 
personal hand sanitizers to all workers directly assisting guests. 
• Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times 
and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when 
needed.  
• Provide resources to promote workers’ personal hygiene. This will include 
tissues, no-touch trash cans, hand soap, adequate time for 
handwashing, alcohol-based hand sanitizers, disinfectant wipes, and 
disposable towels.   
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their 
shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as 
part of the worker’s job duties.  
• Adjust or modify facility hours to provide adequate time for regular 
thorough cleaning. 
• Provide hand sanitizer dispensers throughout facilities including front- and 
back-of-house areas for use by guests and workers. Consider 
implementing hand washing stations for use by guests. Encourage 
people to wash hands and/or use hand sanitizer often while on the 
premises. Never provide hand sanitizers with methanol due to its high 
toxicity to both children and adults. 
• Install and encourage the use of credit cards and hands-free devices, if 
possible, including motion sensor lights, contactless payment systems, 
automatic soap and paper towel dispensers, and timecard systems. 
11
----------------Page (10) Break----------------
• To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases 
associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and 
features (e.g., drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use 
after a prolonged facility shutdown.  
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, use products approved for use 
against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-
approved list and follow product instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to 
be effective against emerging viral pathogens, diluted household 
bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or alcohol solutions 
with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the surface. Provide 
workers training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer’s directions, 
ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. 
Workers using cleaners or disinfectants must wear gloves and other 
protective equipment as required by the product instructions. Follow the 
asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended by the California 
Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation. 
 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• WARNING: physical distancing alone is insufficient to prevent transmission 
of COVID-19.  
• Limit guest groups to a household unit. People from the same household 
do not need to be six feet apart.  
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between people/households. This can include use of physical partitions or 
visual cues (e.g., floor/ground markings or signs to indicate where people 
should sit and stand) and should be used where people form lines or 
congregate including at check-stands, terminals, restrooms, elevator 
lobbies, waiting areas, valet stands, etc. 
• Reconfigure, close, or otherwise remove seats from use to ensure physical 
distancing of at least six feet between attendees from different 
households. This may require seating every other row or blocking off or 
removing seats in a “checkerboard” style (use each row but make sure 
no one is directly behind other guests) so that distances are maintained in 
all directions. Venues without fixed assigned seating (such as lawn viewing 
areas) are not currently allowed.  
• Dedicate workers to help people maintain distances during activities. This 
could include ushering to seats, preventing congregation in bottleneck 
areas, and dismissing guests in an orderly fashion to reduce the crossflow 
of traffic. Manage egress by inviting guests nearest exits to leave seating 
areas first.  
• Do not allow guest to engage in practices that promote people from 
different households to touch, such as high fiving, crowd surfing, etc.  
12
----------------Page (11) Break----------------
• Discourage guests from engaging in yelling, singing, chanting, booing, 
and other practices that may increase the likelihood of transmission from 
contaminated exhaled droplets and aerosols, and ensure all are wearing 
face coverings at all times except when eating or drinking.  
• Prohibit the use of noise makers that require users to exhale air, such as 
vuvuzelas and similar devices. 
• Provide vendors that sell to guests seated in viewing areas gloves and 
personal hand sanitizer. Ensure food and beverage items sold are 
packaged in sealed containers. Implement payment methods that 
minimize passing cards or cash back and forth (use exact cash, do not 
use payment systems that require signature, etc.) 
• Install physical, impermeable barriers or partitions between workers and 
guests if possible, such as at ticket windows, etc., to minimize exposure 
between workers and guests.  
• Utilize telework options and modified work schedules. When feasible and 
necessary, limit the number of workers in the venue at one time. This may 
include scheduling (e.g., staggering preparation times), establishing 
alternating days for onsite reporting, returning to the workspace in phases, 
or continued use of telework when feasible.  
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with guests and other workers (e.g., managing 
inventory rather than working as a cashier or managing administrative 
needs through telework). 
• Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to 
maintain physical distancing protocols.  
• Reconfigure workspaces, if possible, to allow for six feet between workers. 
Hold smaller meetings at facilities to maintain physical distancing 
guidelines and consider holding meetings and rehearsals outside, in larger 
rooms, or via online platforms or telephone.  
• Ensure workers can maintain physical distance in breakrooms, using 
barriers, increasing distance between tables/chairs to separate workers, 
etc. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade coverings 
and seating arrangements that ensures physical distancing. Discourage 
workers from congregating during breaks and ensure they are not eating 
or drinking without face coverings within six feet of each other. 
• Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas, 
such as supply rooms and counter areas, to ensure at least six feet of 
separation. 
• Require workers to not use handshakes, fist or elbow bumps, hugs, and 
similar greetings or other behaviors that break physical distance.  
13
----------------Page (12) Break----------------
• Do not allow people to congregate in high traffic areas such as 
bathrooms, hallways, bar areas, reservation windows, and credit card 
terminals, etc. 
• Discontinue “meet-and-greet,” autograph signing, VIP passes that allow 
guests to access back areas, etc. Strongly consider closing areas meant 
for guests to take photos, such as near event signage or cardboard 
cutouts.  
• Redesign parking lots to limit congregation points and ensure proper 
separation (e.g., every other space, contactless payment, etc.). Prohibit 
tailgating and similar activities that encourage mixing of different 
households in parking and other venue areas. Ensure adequate staffing to 
monitor parking areas for compliance with physical distancing. 
 
Additional Considerations  
Entry and Security 
 
• Ensure parking, entrance, and exit areas are marked, monitored, and 
configured to allow for physical distancing and no crowding or 
congregating. 
• Use of face coverings is mandatory throughout the park in all settings 
indoor and outdoor, unless actively eating and/or drinking. Patrons who 
do not comply should be removed from the facility immediately. Allow for 
exemptions identified in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance. 
• Outside the venue perimeter, provide temperature and/or symptom 
screenings for all attendees, guests, and visitors. Make sure the 
temperature/symptom screener avoids close contact with workers to the 
extent possible.  
• Identify people passing the screening process with a colored wristband or 
other visible way to signify the patron has been screened. Have 
individuals attach the colored wristband to their wrist, clothing, or some 
other visible place. Only people that have the appropriate color 
wristband should be allowed entry to the seating area. 
• Consider ways to schedule staggered ingress in order to minimize lines for 
wanding, bag check, and ticket scanning. Virtual queuing, for example, 
could provide metered access to the front of a line. 
• Protect ticketing offices with impermeable barriers, like Plexiglass. Instruct 
guests where to queue to maintain a minimum of six feet of physical 
distance.   
14
----------------Page (13) Break----------------
• Designate separate routes for entry and exit into facilities, seating areas, 
work areas, etc., if possible, to help maintain physical distancing and 
lessen the instances of people closely passing each other. Establish one-
way directional hallways and passageways for foot traffic, if possible, to 
eliminate workers and guests from passing by one another.  
• Stagger entry and exit by rows and sections to prevent concentrations of 
people on concourses and aisles. Particular attention should be given to 
staggered exiting of venues at the conclusion of an event. Establish 
directional entry and exit into venues whenever possible. 
• Workers checking bags should modify activities to minimize directly 
touching guest items. This could include using styluses or other instruments 
to search bags, asking guests to open bags and move contents, etc. 
Where practices might cause direct contact with patrons or their items, 
workers should immediately sanitize hands or wear disposable gloves and 
change between each guest search. 
• In order to avoid touching attendees’ personal items, operators should 
consider enforcing a small clear bag policy and ask guests to open their 
own bags for inspection. Consider necessary exceptions to the clear bag 
policy for medical and personal hygiene products. 
• Implement security tools that allow workers to maintain at least six feet of 
physical distance from guests. This could include the use of walk through 
metal detectors rather than hand wand metal detectors.  
• Walk-through metal detectors are effective at detecting metallic objects 
while allowing security workers to maintain social distance. Hand wands 
are a less costly alternative which still allow no-contact metal detection, 
but they require the security worker to be closer than six feet from the 
guest. Any worker conducting a pat-down search must wear disposable 
gloves that are immediately discarded after interaction with a guest, 
followed by handwashing or hand sanitizer before putting on a fresh pair 
of gloves. 
• Install and use touchless ticket scanners whenever possible. Ask guests to 
scan tickets themselves rather than passing digital electronic devices or 
paper tickets back and forth between workers and guests. When workers 
must assist guests and touching is necessary, workers must wear a face 
covering and wash hands and/or use hand sanitizer as described in this 
guidance. Guests must wear face coverings during the exchange and be 
encouraged to wash hands and/or use hand sanitizer after exchanging 
goods as well. 
• Discontinue coat check and other amenities that require workers to 
unnecessarily touch guest items and increase the risk of contact of 
contaminated items from different households.   
15
----------------Page (14) Break----------------
• Dedicate workers during breaks to ensure orderly entry and exit from and 
into venue areas. Use workers to preserve appropriate space in queuing 
areas and help customers understand where lines begin as additional 
space may make it difficult to see where to stand.  
• Reconfigure merchandise and other retail sales booths and areas to 
create physical distance between workers and patrons. Encourage pre-
ordering, contactless payment, and other systems that minimize the 
amount of time patrons spend in retail areas. Employers must implement 
queues (signs, stanchions, etc.) to allow patrons to maintain at least six 
feet of physical distance while waiting to pick-up or purchase 
merchandise. 
Venue Support Operations: Sound, Lighting, Etc. 
 
• Clean touchable surfaces between shifts or between users, whichever is 
more frequent, including but not limited to working surfaces, tools, 
handles and latches, and controls on stationary and mobile equipment, 
including surfaces in the cabs of all vehicles. 
• Require workers to wash hands or use sanitizer between the use of shared 
equipment, such as workstation tools, radios, mobilized carts, and other 
items, and allow paid work time to do so. 
• Require PPE and employer-owned and controlled equipment, such as 
hard hats, be sanitized at the end of each shift. Clean and disinfect the 
inside of the equipment, then the outside, then wash hands. 
• Identify “choke points” and high-risk areas where workers are forced to 
stand together, such as hallways, hoists, and elevators and provide 
signage to remind workers to take precautions while moving through 
these areas. 
• Consider options to limit the number of workers needed in back-of-house 
production departments and/or identify ways they can complete tasks 
separately from each other.  
• Evaluate the increased risk from standard working processes involving 
close contact (heavy lifting, working in confined spaces, etc.) and modify 
those work processes, where possible. 
• Limit the shared use of production items to a single worker or a function 
team (e.g., sound equipment should be handled by a designated person 
or team). All items must be thoroughly cleaned between each use. 
• Disinfect all communication technology before and after each use and 
label relevant tools with the name of the user to avoid sharing the tools. 
• For workers who handle keys, open car doors, or touch guests’ items, 
allow time to wash hands and/or use hand sanitizer.

1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Employers must 
comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as 
guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California 
Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers must be prepared to alter their 
operations as those guidelines change.
