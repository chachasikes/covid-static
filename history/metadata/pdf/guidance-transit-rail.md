OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that 
person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not required)
and customers/clients,
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for public and private passenger carriers (e.g. shuttle 
providers, taxis, and rideshare operators), transit agencies, California state-supported 
intercity passenger rail operators (Capitol Corridor, San Joaquins, and Pacific Surfliner), 
and passenger vessel operations. The guidance is intended to support a safe, clean 
environment for workers and customers. The guidance is not intended to revoke or 
repeal any worker rights, either statutory, regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not 
exhaustive, as it does not include county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any 
existing safety and health-related regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1
Additionally, it is not intended to conflict with federal or state requirements for rail or

transit vehicles or facilities. Stay current on changes to public health guidance and 
state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has more 
comprehensive guidance on their Cal/OSHA Interim General Guidelines on Protecting 
Workers from COVID-19 webpage. CDC has specific guidelines for the transit industry: 
•Bus Transit Operators
•Rail Transit Operators
•Transit Maintenance Workers
•Transit Station Workers
•Rideshare, Taxi, Limo and Other Drivers-for-Hire
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or
distribution to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of
the person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to
physically distance;
•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present.
When no passengers are present, face coverings are strongly
recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering 
requirements in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful 
3

workplace.  Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse 
workers for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets 
one of the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would 
otherwise be required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with 
others cannot wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with 
a non-restrictive alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the 
bottom edge, if feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not 
exclude any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is 
complying with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling 
these exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Worksite Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every 
location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and 
work tasks, and designate a person at each establishment to implement 
the plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
operation is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers or customers. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the establishment for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as 
needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has 
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) and 
close contacts. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
Topics for Worker Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to 
contracting the virus. 
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks 
using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work:

o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, such 
as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, 
fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, 
sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, 
OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR 
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone 
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered 
potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis 
only if 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their 
symptoms have improved, and the worker has had no fevers 
(without the use of fever reducing medications) for the last 72 
hours. A worker without symptoms who was diagnosed with 
COVID-19 can return to work only if 10 days have passed since 
the date of the first positive COVID-19 test. 
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including 
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible 
to children) when workers cannot get to a sink or handwashing station, 
per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time 
(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not 
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth.

o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or 
discarded after each shift. 
o The importance of passengers wearing face coverings and that the 
operator has the right to cancel reservations for passengers not 
wearing them. 
• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, 
and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face 
coverings. Training should also include the employer’s policies on how 
people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will be 
handled. 
• Ensure any independent contractors, temporary or contract workers, and 
volunteers at the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention 
policies and have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these 
responsibilities ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary 
and/or contract workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive 
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional 
information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers’ 
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under 
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and workers’ rights to workers’ 
compensation benefits and presumption of the work-relatedness of 
COVID-19 pursuant to the Governor’s Executive order N-62-20 while that 
Order is in effect. 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers 
entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom 
screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible. 
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to 
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed 
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC 
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. 
• Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to 
stay home. 
• Workers should provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary.

• Workers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to 
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are 
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly 
touched items. 
• Individuals entering a facility should be restricted to only those classified 
as essential by management and they must complete a temperature 
and/or symptom screening before entering. 
• Public and private passenger carriers, transit, vessel, and/or rail agencies 
and entities must take reasonable measures to remind the public that 
they need to use face coverings, practice physical distancing, and avoid 
directly facing other passengers when physical distancing is difficult. They 
should also communicate any updated ridership practices and any 
changes to the frequency of service timetables to the public. Public 
communication could include those listed (above) and may also include 
updates to text messaging or transit apps. 
• Taxis, rideshare, shuttle, limousine, and other passenger transit operators 
should take steps to ensure customers are fully aware of the company’s 
new policies and procedures when using the riding service. Passengers 
must be notified before booking a ride that they must use face coverings 
and that the operator has the right to cancel reservations for passengers 
not wearing them. 
• Where feasible, taxi and rideshare drivers should be provided a supply of 
face coverings to give to passengers who arrive for a ride service without 
them. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Perform thorough cleaning on high traffic areas within transit and rail 
stations, in transit and rail vehicles, and water transport vessels like ferries 
and boats, on a regular basis. Areas could include break rooms, restroom 
surfaces, lunch areas, changing areas and areas of ingress and egress, 
including stairways, handrails, and elevator controls, etc. Frequently 
disinfect commonly used surfaces, including kiosks, ticket machines, 
turnstiles, benches, elevator buttons, system maps, doorknobs, toilets, 
handwashing facilities, equipment handles, maintenance equipment, 
and tools. 
• Perform routine cleaning and disinfection of all frequently touched 
surfaces within all vehicles used to transport passengers, including but not 
limited to, seats, arm rests, door handles, seat belt buckles, light and air 
controls, walls and windows, grab handles, pull-cords and buttons used 
by riders to request a stop.

• Clean all areas of drivers’ cabs between shifts or users, whichever is more 
frequent. Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during 
their shifts. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours 
as part of the worker’s job duties. 
• When assisting passengers using a wheelchair or other mobility device, or 
who require operator assistance, operators must sanitize their hands 
before and after the interaction. 
• Avoid sharing phones, other work tools, or equipment wherever possible. 
Never share PPE. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, workers should use products 
approved for use against COVID-19 listed on the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. 
Use disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral 
pathogens, diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon 
of water), or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are 
appropriate for the surface. Provide workers training on the chemical 
hazards, manufacturer’s directions, ventilation requirements, and 
Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or 
disinfectants should wear gloves and other protective equipment as 
required by the product. Follow the asthma-safer cleaning methods 
recommended by the California Department of Public Health and ensure 
there is sufficient ventilation. 
• To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases 
associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and 
features (e.g., drinking fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility 
shutdown. 
• Equip stations, transit and rail offices, transit and rail vehicles, and 
passenger vehicles with proper sanitation products, including hand 
sanitizer and disinfecting wipes, and provide personal hand sanitizers to 
all frontline staff (e.g., operators and drivers). 
• Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times 
and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when 
needed. 
• Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that 
can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter 
wherever possible. 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading 
vehicle and building air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and 
making other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and 
ventilation in vehicles, offices, break areas, and other spaces.

Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Reduce maximum occupancy onboard transit and rail vehicles and 
vessels to support physical distancing. Remove or space seats to support 
physical distancing or use colored tape to mark the seats that riders are 
allowed to use or block off seats that are not to be used. Where possible, 
use additional buses or transit vehicles to support excess capacity on 
busy lines and ensure physical distancing of passengers. 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between transit and rail operators and passengers. This can include use 
of physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored tape, 
taking passenger seats or spaces out of service, or signs to indicate to 
passengers where they should not sit or stand near the bus operator). If 
seating is taken out of service, be mindful of ensuring compliance with 
minimum requirements for handicapped-accessible seating. 
• In public transit vehicles, for example city busses, seats within six feet of 
the operator should be blocked off and unavailable to passengers if it 
does not impact the requirements for handicapped-accessible seating. 
Operators will have the option to request passengers avoid standing or 
sitting within six feet of them. Where possible, install Plexiglas or other 
appropriate barriers in transit and rail vehicles to minimize exposure 
between operators and passengers. 
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., managing 
administrative needs through telework). 
• Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to 
maintain physical distancing protocols. 
• Close breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance between 
tables/chairs to separate workers and discourage congregating during 
breaks. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade covers 
and seating that ensures physical distancing. 
• Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas 
to ensure at least six feet of separation to limit transmission of the virus. 
• Require passengers to purchase tickets and add value to transit and rail 
cards online to minimize the need for use of machines at the station. 
• Develop a passenger entry and exit plan to minimize physical contact 
and crowding with other passengers during entry and exit of the transit 
vehicle.

• When traveling by a water transport vessel, such as a ferry or boat, ask 
the passengers to indicate to a crew member if they are traveling 
together as party, if feasible. The crew will help passengers queue for 
boarding and disembarking the vessel in physically distanced small 
groups. 
• Track the routes on which physical distancing is a challenge due to 
ridership. Adjust bus or transit routes and scheduling to account for the 
need for additional busses, trains, and other transit vehicles during peak 
ridership hours on busy routes. 
Additional Considerations for Passenger 
Carriers (Taxis, Rideshare Vehicles, Shuttles, 
Limousines, etc.) 
• Pooled rides offered by ridesharing companies, which includes providing 
a carpool type of option for different parties traveling in a similar 
direction, should be suspended until further public health guidance is 
provided for restarting such rides. 
• Taxi and rideshare operators and private transit companies should 
develop a process that permits both drivers and riders to cancel rides 
without penalty if the other party is not wearing a face covering. This 
policy should be communicated to passengers before they book a ride. 
• Provide drivers with an adequate supply of materials required to clean 
and disinfect frequently touched surfaces of the vehicle. Drivers should 
have cleaning and disinfecting spray and/or disposable wipes in their 
vehicles. Drivers should follow manufacturer’s directions for proper 
cleaning and disinfecting in the vehicle, including using cleaning 
techniques appropriate for the surface. Drivers should be instructed on 
the hazards of the product(s) and any necessary protective measures. 
Ensure adequate ventilation when cleaning/disinfecting vehicles. The 
steering wheel, gear shift, signal levers, and other commonly-touched 
vehicle parts should be regularly cleaned and disinfected. Provide lined 
trash receptacles to be placed in the vehicle to properly dispose of 
disinfectant wipes and other items. 
• High-touch areas within the vehicle frequently touched by passengers 
should be frequently cleaned and disinfected at the beginning and end 
of each shift, and between transporting passengers. This includes the 
door frame, handles, windows, seatbelt buckles, and trunk latch. Provide 
time for workers to implement cleaning practices between transporting 
passengers. If cleaning is assigned to the driver they must be 
compensated for that time.

• Where possible, use protective barriers such as disposable mats and seat 
coverings. 
• Consider installing an impermeable barrier between the front and rear 
seats. 
• Drivers should consider asking passengers to handle their own personal 
bags and belongings during pick-up and drop-off, if possible. If providing 
such services, request that the passengers maintain a minimum of six feet 
distance. After touching passenger belongings, drivers should use hand 
sanitizer. 
• Riders should sit in the back seat to maximize distance between the 
passenger and the driver. Rideshare apps should remind passengers of 
this updated requirement and the number of available seats when 
making a request for a vehicle and through emails, texts, or other 
customer communication tools. 
• Rideshare and taxi apps and taxi phone operators should remind 
passengers to wear face coverings and notify them that the ride may be 
cancelled if they do not wear a face covering. 
• Avoid using the recirculated air option for the vehicle’s ventilation during 
passenger transport; where possible, use the vehicle’s vents to bring in 
outside air and/or lower the vehicle windows. 
• Drivers should suspend offering items like mints, phone chargers, or 
magazines that are often provided as a passenger service. 
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Public and private 
passenger carriers, transit agencies, and intercity passenger rail operators must comply with all 
Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as guidance from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public 
Health (CDPH). Additionally, these entities must be prepared to alter their operations as those 
guidelines change.
