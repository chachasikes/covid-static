OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that 
person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, restaurants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not required)
and customers/clients,
frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention
plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus.

PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for retailers to support a safe, clean environment for 
workers and customers. Businesses must identify and monitor the County Risk Level for 
the county the business is operating in and make required adjustments to their 
operations: 
•Purple – Widespread – Tier 1: Indoor operations are permitted but must be limited
to 25% capacity. Grocery stores must limit to 50% capacity. All retail operations
must follow this guidance.
•Red – Substantial – Tier 2: Indoor operations are permitted but must be limited to
50% capacity. Grocery stores can operate at full capacity. All retail operations
must follow this guidance.
•Orange – Moderate – Tier 3: Indoor operations are permitted at full capacity and
retail operations must follow this guidance.
•Yellow – Minimal – Tier 4: Indoor operations are permitted at full capacity and
retail operations must follow this guidance.

Please note that local health departments can have more restrictive criteria and 
different closures. Find your county’s local information. 
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health- related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public 
health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. 
Cal/OSHA has more safety and health guidance on their Cal/OSHA Guidance on 
Requirements to Protect Workers from Coronavirus webpage. CDC has additional 
guidance for businesses and employers and for food and grocery retailers. 
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. Complete details, 
including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be found in the 
guidance.  
The CDPH Face Covering Guidance is subject to additional updates based on the 
current scientific understanding of transmission of the virus causing COVID-19. Please 
check the CDPH website for any revisions.

 Workplace Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every 
location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and 
work tasks, and designate a person at each establishment to implement 
the plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
operation is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers or customers. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the establishment for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as 
needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has 
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines and orders or 
guidance from the local health department. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive 
worker(s) and close contacts. 
• Notify all employees in writing, and employers of subcontracted 
employees, who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and report 
workplace outbreaks to the local health department. For additional 
information on employer responsibilities under AB 685 (Chapter 84, 
Statutes of 2020), refer to the Enhanced Enforcement and Employer 
Reporting Requirements from Cal/OSHA and the Employer Questions 
about AB 685 from CDPH. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited.

Topics for Worker Training 
•Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which
people are at higher risk for severe illness or death.
•Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks
using CDC guidelines.
•The importance of not coming to work:
oIf a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the
CDC, such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or
difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache,
new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose,
nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, OR
oIf a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been
released from isolation, OR
oIf, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with
someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is
considered potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation).
•To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only after
meeting CDPH Guidance on Returning to Work or School Following
COVID-19 Diagnosis.
•To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face.
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage.
•The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible
to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). Never use hand sanitizers with
methanol due to its high toxicity to both children and adults.
•The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time
(see Physical Distancing section below).
•Proper use of face coverings, including:
oFace coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE).
oFace coverings do not replace the need for physical distancing and
frequent handwashing.
oFace coverings must cover the nose and mouth.
5
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
oWorkers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or
adjusting face coverings.
oAvoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth.
oFace coverings must not be shared and should be washed or discarded
after each shift.
•Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings.
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled.
•Ensure any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at
the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and
have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of
time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers.
•Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional
information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers’
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
•Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the
beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers
entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom
screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible.
•If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative
to providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was
performed prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and
follows CDC guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training
section above
•Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to
stay home.
•Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. This
includes protections for cashiers, baggers, and other workers with
regular and repeated interaction with customers.
•Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful
6
----------------Page (5) Break----------------
to supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples 
are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling 
commonly touched items. 
•Workers who consistently must be within six feet of guests or co-workers
must wear a secondary barrier (e.g., face shield or safety goggles) in
addition to a face covering. All workers should minimize the amount of
time spent within six feet of guests.
•Workers must also be provided and use protective equipment when
offloading and storing delivered goods.
•Retailers must take reasonable measures, including public address
announcements, posting signage in strategic and highly-visible
locations, and in reservation confirmations, to remind the public that
they must use face coverings whenever not eating or drinking (unless
exempted per the CDPH Face Covering Guidance), practice physical
distancing, not touch their face, frequently wash their hands with soap
and water for at least 20 seconds, and use hand sanitizer.
Ventilation, Cleaning, and Disinfecting 
Protocols 
•Where possible, install portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrade
the building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and make
other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and
ventilation in offices and other indoor spaces.
•Check the CDPH website periodically for updates on indoor air quality
and ventilation guidance for airborne diseases in indoor settings.
•Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas, such as break rooms,
lunch areas and areas of ingress and egress including stairways, stairwells,
escalators, handrails, and elevator controls. Frequently disinfect
commonly used surfaces, including shopping carts, baskets, conveyor
belts, registers (including self-checkout), scanners, register telephones,
hand-held devices, counters, door handles, shelving, ATM PIN pads,
customer assistance call buttons, handwashing facilities, etc.
•Clean and disinfect shared equipment, including but not limited to,
pallet jacks, ladders, supply carts, time clocks, payment portals, and
styluses between each use.
•Clean touchable surfaces between shifts or between users, whichever is
more frequent, including but not limited to working surfaces, tools, and
stationary and mobile equipment controls.
7
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
•Equip customer entrances and exits, checkout stations, customer
changing rooms with proper sanitation products, including hand
sanitizer and sanitizing wipes, and provide personal hand sanitizers to
all frontline staff (e.g., cashiers).
•Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times
and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when
needed.
•To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases
associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and
features (e.g., drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to
use after a prolonged facility shutdown.
•Provide resources to promote workers’ personal hygiene. This will include
tissues, no-touch trash cans, hand soap, adequate time for hand- 
washing, alcohol-based hand sanitizers, disinfectants, and disposable
towels.
•When choosing disinfecting chemicals, use products approved for use
against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-
approved list and follow product instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to
be effective against emerging viral pathogens, diluted household
bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or alcohol solutions
with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the surface. Provide
workers training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer’s directions,
ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use.
Workers using cleaners or disinfectants must wear gloves and other
protective equipment as required by the product instructions. Follow the
asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended by the California
Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation.
•Adjust or modify store hours to provide adequate time for regular,
thorough cleaning and product stocking. Stagger stocking so that
associates are in different aisles.
•Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their
shift. Assign cleaning assignments during working hours as part of the
employee’s job duties.  Procure options for third-party cleaning
companies to assist with the increased cleaning demand, as needed.
•Install hands-free devices, if possible, including motion sensor lights,
contactless payment systems, automatic soap and paper towel
dispensers, and timecard systems.
•Encourage the use of debit or credit cards by customers, for
example, through signage.

Physical Distancing Guidelines 
•WARNING: physical distancing alone is insufficient to prevent transmission
of COVID-19.
•Retailers should create clearly-marked curbside or outside pickup points
that maintain physical distance with visual cues or other measures, and
have purchased goods available there or available through home
delivery.
•Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet
between workers and customers. This can include use of physical partitions
or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored tape, or signs to indicate to
where workers and/or customers should stand).
•Take measures at checkout stations to minimize exposure between
cashiers and customers, such as Plexiglas barriers.
•Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., managing
inventory rather than working as a cashier or managing administrative
needs through telework).
•Adjust in-person meetings, if they are necessary, to ensure physical
distancing and use smaller individual meetings at facilities to maintain
physical distancing guidelines.
•Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas to
ensure at least six feet of separation to limit transmission of the virus.
•Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to
maintain physical distancing protocols.
•Ensure workers can maintain physical distance in breakrooms, using
barriers, increasing distance between tables/chairs to separate workers,
etc. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade coverings and
seating arrangements that ensures physical distancing. Discourage workers
from congregating during breaks and ensure they are not eating or
drinking without face coverings within six feet of each other.
•Close in-store bars, bulk-bin options, and public seating areas and
discontinue product sampling.
•Dedicate shopping hours for vulnerable populations, including seniors and
those medically vulnerable, preferably at a time following a complete
cleaning.
•Increase pickup and delivery service options for customers to help minimize
in-store contact and maintain social distancing, such as online ordering
and curbside pick- up.
9
----------------Page (8) Break----------------
•Provide a single, clearly designated entrance and separate exit to help
maintain physical distancing where possible.
•Be prepared to queue customers outside while still maintaining physical
distance, including through the use of visual cues.
•Encourage workers to practice physical distancing during pickup and
delivery by talking with the customer through a passenger window, loading
items directly into the customer’s trunk without contact, or leaving items at
their door.
•Make some locations pickup- or delivery-only to minimize worker/customer
contact, where possible.
•Install transfer-aiding materials, such as shelving and bulletin boards, to
reduce person-to-person hand-offs where possible. Wherever possible, use
contactless signatures for deliveries.
•Expand direct store delivery window hours to spread out deliveries and
prevent overcrowding.
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. The retail industry must 
comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as 
guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California 
Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers must be prepared to alter their 
operations as those guidelines change.
