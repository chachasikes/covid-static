COVID-19 
INDUSTRY 
GUIDANCE: 
Hotels, Lodging, and 
Short-Term Rentals 
October 20, 2020 
This guidance is designed to address 
sectors and activities opening statewide. 
However, local health officers may 
implement more stringent rules tailored 
to local epidemiological conditions, so 
employers should also confirm relevant 
local opening policies.

OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that 
person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, restaurants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not
required) and customers,
frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention
plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus.

PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for the hotel, lodging, and short-term rental industries 
(lodging operators) to support a safe, clean environment for workers and customers. 
Businesses must identify and monitor the County Risk Level for the county the business is 
operating in and make required adjustments to their operations: 
•Purple – Widespread – Tier 1: Lodging operations are permitted. Fitness centers
must operate outdoors. Outdoor hot tubs can open only for use by household
groups or in cases where six feet of distancing can be maintained. Indoor pools,
hot tubs, saunas, and steam rooms must remain closed. Lodging operations must
follow this guidance.
•Red – Substantial – Tier 2: Lodging operations are permitted. Fitness centers can
open indoors at 10% capacity. Indoor pools, hot tubs, saunas, and steam rooms
must remain closed. Lodging operators must follow the modifications in this
guidance.
•Orange – Moderate – Tier 3: Lodging operations are permitted. Fitness centers
can open indoors at 25% capacity. Indoor pools can open when physical
distancing can be maintained for non-household groups. Indoor pools do not
include any indoor water parks or water rides. Indoor hot tubs, saunas, and
steam rooms must remain closed. Lodging operators must follow the
modifications in this guidance.
•Yellow – Minimal – Tier 4: Lodging operations are permitted. Fitness centers can
open indoors at 50% capacity. Indoor pools, hot tubs, saunas, and steam rooms
can open but physical distancing must be maintained for non-household groups.
Indoor pools do not include any indoor water parks or water rides. Lodging
operators must follow the modifications in this guidance.
For the most updated information on county tier status, visit Blueprint for a Safer 
Economy. Please note that local health departments can have more restrictive criteria 
and different closures. Find your county’s local information. 
NOTE: Lodging operators may have a number of operational aspects and service 
offerings available in other guidance on the Industry Guidance to Reduce Risk website. 
Operators must review this guidance to apply the appropriate protocols to all aspects 
of their operations. Such operations include: 
•Restaurants, dining, and food service (Restaurant guidance)
•Bars (Bars, Breweries, and Distilleries guidance)
•Gyms, fitness centers, and exercise instruction (see Fitness Facilities guidance)
•Gift shops and retail operations (Retail guidance)
•Family entertainment centers, including miniature golf and arcades (Family
Entertainment Centers guidance)
•Child care (Child Care guidance)
3
----------------Page (2) Break----------------
•Trams, shuttles, and other transit (Public and Private Passenger Carriers, Transit,
and Intercity Passenger Rail guidance)
oLimit shuttle service whenever possible and in accordance with obligations
to individuals with disabilities.
•Grounds, building maintenance, custodial services (Limited Services guidance)
Hotel, lodging, and short-term rental operations with meeting venues, banquet halls, or 
convention centers must keep those establishments closed until allowed to resume 
modified or full operation. Property managers, timeshare operators, and other rental unit 
owners and operators must only rent unoccupied units and cannot rent rooms or spaces 
within an occupied residence until otherwise notified. A residence or unit that is rented 
while the operator is not physically present, or has a separate exterior entrance and exit 
that does not require the use of shared facilities, and is otherwise unoccupied, should be 
considered an unoccupied unit. When allowed to reopen to modified or full operation, 
operators should refer to the Blueprint for a Safer Economy.  
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include county 
health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related regulatory 
requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public health 
guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has 
more safety and health guidance on their Cal/OSHA Guidance on Requirements to 
Protect Workers from Coronavirus webpage. CDC has additional guidance for businesses 
and employers. 
Required Use of Face Coverings
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. Complete details, 
including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be found in the guidance. 
The CDPH Face Covering Guidance is subject to additional updates based on the 
current scientific understanding of transmission of the virus causing COVID-19. Please 
check the CDPH website for any revisions.

----------------Page (3) Break----------------
Workplace Specific Plan 
•Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at
every facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas
and work tasks, and designate a person at each facility to implement the
plan.
•Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions.
•Identify contact information for the local health department where the
facility is located for communicating information about COVID-19
outbreaks among workers or guests.
•Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives.
•Regularly evaluate the workplace for compliance with the plan and
document and correct deficiencies identified.
•Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as
needed to prevent further cases.
•Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines and orders or
guidance from the local health department.
•Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive
worker(s) and close contacts.
•Notify all employees in writing, and employers of subcontracted
employees, who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and report
workplace outbreaks to the local health department. For additional
information on employer responsibilities under AB 685 (Chapter 84,
Statutes of 2020), refer to the Enhanced Enforcement and Employer
Reporting Requirements from Cal/OSHA and the Employer Questions
about AB 685 from CDPH.
•Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited.
Topics for Worker Training 
•Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which
people are at higher risk for severe illness or death.
5
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
•Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks
using CDC guidelines.
•The importance of not coming to work:
oIf a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, such
as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,
fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell,
sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea,
OR
oIf a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been
released from isolation, OR
oIf, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered potentially
infectious (i.e. still on isolation).
•To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only after
meeting CDPH Guidance on Returning to Work or School Following
COVID-19 Diagnosis.
•To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face.
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage.
•The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible
to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). Never use hand sanitizers with
methanol due to its high toxicity to both children and adults.
•The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time (see
Physical Distancing section below).
•Proper use of face coverings, including:
oFace coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE).
oFace coverings do not replace the need for physical distancing and
frequent handwashing.
oFace coverings must cover the nose and mouth.
oWorkers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or
adjusting face coverings.
oAvoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth.
oFace coverings must not be shared and should be washed or discarded
after each shift.

----------------Page (5) Break----------------
• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and 
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. 
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who 
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled. 
• Ensure any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at 
the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and 
have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of 
time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive 
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional 
information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers’ 
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under 
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. 
 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors or contractors entering the 
establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom screener avoids close 
contact with workers to the extent possible.  
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to 
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed 
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC 
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. 
• Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to 
stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to 
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are 
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly 
touched items. 
• Workers who consistently must be within six feet of guests or co-workers 
must wear a secondary barrier (e.g., face shield or safety goggles) in 
addition to a face covering. All workers should minimize the amount of 
time spent within six feet of guests. 
• Housekeeping must only service rooms when guests are not present. 
Housekeepers should be instructed to minimize contact with guests’ 
7
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
personal belongings when cleaning. Housekeepers should be instructed to 
have ventilation systems operating and/or open windows whenever 
possible to increase air circulation. 
•Employers should encourage handwashing, with soap and water, and/or
using proper hand sanitizer for workers after interactions with guests,
cleaning rooms, and opening mail or handle other commonly touched
items. Valet service drivers, baggage handlers, and housekeepers should
wash their hands regularly during their shift and/or use proper hand
sanitizer.
•If possible, baggage deliveries should be done when guests are not in their
rooms.
•Lodging operators should take steps to ensure guests are fully aware of the
facility’s new policies and procedures prior to their arrival. Recommended
policies and procedures include that the lodging operator has the right to
cancel reservations for parties with symptomatic visitors and that there are
new check-in procedures, physical distancing requirements, and cleaning
and disinfecting schedules for accommodations, amenities, and common
areas like the check-in/registration area.
•Remind guests in advance to bring a face covering, otherwise they
should not be allowed to enter the premises (unless exempted per the
CDPH Face Covering Guidance). Consider making face coverings
available for guests who may arrive without them.
•Guests and visitors should be temperature and/or screened upon arrival
and asked to use hand sanitizer and to wear a face covering. Face
coverings should be provided to guests who arrive without them, if
feasible. Lodging operators have the right to cancel reservations for
individuals/parties with symptomatic guests and refuse entry.
•Appropriate signage should also be prominently displayed outlining proper
face covering usage and current physical distancing practices in use
throughout the property.
Ventilation, Cleaning, and Disinfecting 
Protocols 
•Where possible, install portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrade the
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and make other
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in
offices, guest rooms, and other indoor spaces.
•Any on-site restaurants should increase fresh air circulation by opening
windows or doors, if possible, and in accordance with security and safety
8
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
protocols. 
•Check the CDPH website periodically for updates on indoor air quality
and ventilation guidance for airborne diseases in indoor settings.
•Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas such as hotel lobbies, front
desk check-in counters, bell desks, break rooms and lunch areas,
changing areas, loading docks, kitchens, and areas of ingress and egress
including stairways, stairwells, handrails, and elevator controls.
•Disinfect commonly used surfaces throughout the day and evening,
including door handles, vending and ice machines, light switches, phones,
washer and dryer doors and controls, baggage carts, shuttle door
handles, toilets, and handwashing facilities. Disinfect surfaces during daily
room cleanings. Clean dirty items before disinfecting.
•Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift.
Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as part of
the worker’s job duties.
•Equip workstations, desks, and help counters with proper sanitation
products, including hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes, and provide
personal hand sanitizers to all worker directly assisting customers.
•Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times and
provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when needed.
•When choosing disinfecting chemicals, use products approved for use
against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-
approved list and follow product instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to
be effective against emerging viral pathogens, diluted household bleach
solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or alcohol solutions with at
least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the surface. Provide workers
training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer’s directions, ventilation
requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers using
cleaners or disinfectants must wear gloves and other protective
equipment as required by the product instructions. Follow the asthma-safer
cleaning methods recommended by the California Department of Public
Health and ensure proper ventilation.
•Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods
that can disperse pathogens into the air unless all persons in the area
have appropriate PPE. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever
possible.
•To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated
with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g.,
drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged
facility shutdown.
9
----------------Page (8) Break----------------
•Avoid sharing phones, tablets, laptops, desks, pens, other work supplies, or
offices wherever possible. Never share PPE. Any shared tools and
equipment should be cleaned and disinfected before, during and after
each shift or anytime the equipment is transferred to a new worker. This
includes phones, radios, computers and other communication devices,
payment terminals, kitchen implements, engineering tools, safety buttons,
folios, housekeeping carts and cleaning equipment, keys, time clocks, and
all other direct contact items.
•Kitchen items, including pots, pans, and utensils, must be cleaned
between each guest stay. All dishes must be washed, including the ones
in the cabinet and others that may have been left in different rooms.
Provide adequate dish soap and new, unused sponges for each guest
upon arrival.
•Properly clean all appliances and kitchen areas, including refrigerator
shelving, the oven stovetop, coffee-makers, toasters, pantry shelves,
and other areas.
•Dirty linens should be removed and transported from guest rooms in
single-use, sealed bags. Removal and cleaning of all towels and linens at
the conclusion of each guest stay should include all items, regardless of
whether they appear to have been used or not. These items should be
bagged in the guest room to eliminate excess contact while being
transported. All bed linen and laundry should be washed at a high
temperature and cleaned in accordance with CDC guidelines.
•Consider leaving rooms vacant for 24 to 72 hours after a guest has
departed, if feasible.
•In the event of a presumptive case of COVID-19, the guest’s room should
be removed from service and quarantined. The guest room should not be
returned to service until case has been confirmed or cleared. In the
event of a positive case, the room should only be returned to service
after undergoing an enhanced disinfection protocol in accordance with
CDC guidelines.
•Install hand sanitizer dispensers, touchless whenever possible, at key guest
and worker entrances and contact areas such as driveways, reception
areas, hotel lobbies, restaurant entrances, meeting and convention
spaces, elevator landings, pools, salons, and exercise areas.
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
•WARNING: physical distancing alone is insufficient to prevent transmission
of COVID-19.
•Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet
10
----------------Page (9) Break----------------
between and among workers, guests, and the public. These can include 
use of physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings or signs to 
indicate to where workers and/or guests should stand). Any area where 
guests or workers queue should be clearly marked for appropriate physical 
distancing. This includes check-in, check-out, elevator lobbies, coffee 
shops and dining, and taxi and ridesharing lines. 
•Physical distancing protocols should be used in worker break areas, uniform
control areas, training classrooms, shared office spaces, the worker
services window (via a teller style window), and other high- density areas in
order to ensure appropriate distancing between workers.
•Pre-shift meetings should be conducted virtually or in areas that allow for
appropriate physical distancing between workers. Larger departments
should stagger arrival times to minimize traffic volume in back of house
corridors and service elevators.
•Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to
maintain physical distancing protocols.
•Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., managing
inventory rather than working at the concierge desk or managing
administrative needs through telework).
•Ensure workers can maintain physical distance in breakrooms, using
barriers, increasing distance between tables/chairs to separate workers,
etc. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade coverings and
seating arrangements that ensures physical distancing. Discourage workers
from congregating during breaks and ensure they are not eating or
drinking without face coverings within six feet of each other.
•Redesign office spaces, cubicles, lobbies, front desk check-in areas,
business centers, concierge service areas, and other spaces to ensure
workspaces and guest accommodations allow for at least six feet
distancing.
•Discourage workers from congregating in high traffic areas such as
bathrooms and hallways and establish directional hallways and
passageways for foot traffic, if possible, to eliminate people from passing
by one another.
•Limit the number of individuals riding in an elevator. Use signage to
communicate these requirements.
•Require workers to avoid handshakes and similar greetings or other
behaviors that break physical distance.
•Eliminate person-to-person contact for delivery of goods to physical offices.
Avoid sharing others’ pens and clipboards, and wash or sanitize hands in
between uses.
11
----------------Page (10) Break----------------
•Guests should enter through doors that are either propped open, if possible
and in adherence to security protocols, or are automated or manually
operated by a worker who is frequently handwashing and/or using proper
hand sanitizer.
•Implement peak period queueing procedures, including a lobby greeter
and having guests queue outside to maintain at least six feet of physical
distance between persons.
•Guest room service, laundry and dry-cleaning services, and amenity
deliveries should be made available using contactless pick-up and delivery
protocols wherever possible.
Additional Considerations for Short Term Rental 
Units 
•Property managers, timeshare operators, and other rental unit owners and
operators must only rent unoccupied units and cannot rent rooms or
spaces within an occupied residence until otherwise notified. A residence
or unit that is rented while the operator is not physically present or has a
separate exterior entrance and exit that does not require the use of shared
facilities, and is otherwise unoccupied, should be considered an
unoccupied unit. It can be very difficult to maintain proper cleaning and
disinfecting protocols when residents, tenants, and guests from different
households share common items like kitchen appliances, laundry facilities,
etc. Shared, temporary housing also presents challenges with physical
distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
•Property managers, timeshare operators, and other rental unit owners and
operators should offer self or remote check-in and checkout, where
possible. Consider installing a key lockbox or smart lock with a keypad and
provide renters the appropriate self check-in instructions.
•If possible, implement standard check-in and checkout times, and avoid
early arrivals or late departures to minimize the possibility of disrupting the
enhanced cleaning process between guest stays.
•Appropriate signage should be prominently displayed at the property
entrance and other strategic locations on the property outlining proper
face covering usage and current physical distancing practices in use
throughout the property.
•Take the proper steps to thoroughly clean and disinfect the rental unit after
each guest stay. This includes wiping down and cleaning and disinfecting
all high-touch areas, including bed rails, tables, TV remotes, headboards,
countertops, kitchen appliances, refrigerator handles, stove knobs, mirrors,
and other items.
12
----------------Page (11) Break----------------
•Remove all leftover recycling, garbage, and trash from the rental unit. Line
all the garbage cans, which will make it easier to dispose of tissues and
other waste. Empty any food items the previous guest may have left in the
refrigerator, freezer, and pantry.
•All linens must be removed and laundered between each guest stay,
including items that appear to not have been used. When cleaning
bedding, towels, or other laundered items in rental units, wear disposable
gloves when handling dirty laundry and discard them after each use. Wash
hands with soap or use hand sanitizer immediately after gloves are
removed. Do not store extra linens or in the rental unit. Provide such items
only on request.
•Do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus
through the air. Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. Launder items using the warmest appropriate
water setting for the items and dry items completely. Clean and disinfect
laundry hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. If possible,
consider placing a bag liner that is either disposable and thrown away
after each use or can be laundered after each use.
•Clean all soft surfaces based on the manufacturer’s instructions, as
appropriate. Remove visible dirt and grime and then clean with the
appropriate cleaner for the material. If possible, machine-wash items
according to the manufacturer’s directions.
•Kitchen items, including pots, pans, and utensils, must be cleaned between
each guest stay. All dishes must be washed, including the ones in the
cabinet and others that may have been left in different rooms. Provide
adequate dish soap and new, unused sponges for each guest upon
arrival.
•After each guest stay, properly clean all appliances and kitchen areas,
including refrigerator shelving, the oven stovetop, coffee-makers, toasters,
pantry shelves, and other areas.
•Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that can
disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever
possible.
•Bathroom toilets, showers, bathtubs, sinks, cabinets, and shelving should be
disinfected with a multi-surface cleaner approved for use against COVID-
19 by the EPA. Mirrors and any glass should be properly wiped down. The
bathroom floor should also be vacuumed and/or mopped.
•Equip the rental unit with additional hand soap, paper towels, toilet paper,
disinfecting spray or wipes, and hand sanitizer.
•If using an external or professional cleaning company, communicate
expectations and plans for cleaning and disinfection standards, and get
13
----------------Page (12) Break----------------
periodic confirmation that they are being followed by the contracted 
company. 
•Communicate with guests on the cleaning and safety measures
implemented, both pre-stay and during stay, via the listing content and
property information booklet. Ensure guests understand all check-in and
checkout protocols and any updated building or amenity policies (e.g.
changes to services in apartment buildings).
•Service requests should be considered with regard for the safety of
maintenance providers and guests. To limit exposure, defer nonessential
maintenance while the rental unit is occupied and handle only emergency
or urgent issues as allowed by applicable law where possible.
•Ensure that any HVAC/air filters have been replaced per the
manufacturer’s directions. Consider whether more regular replacement of
the filters is necessary. Use high filtration efficiency filters. Do not touch the
surface of used air filters and remove and dispose of them with minimal
disturbance using disposable gloves.
•Consider leaving the rental vacant for 24 to 72 hours after a guest has
departed, if feasible.
•Any rental unit intended for large gatherings, including conferences or
meetings, should not be opened until such operations can resume.
Additional Considerations for Swimming Pools 
and Aquatic Venues 
•Lodging operators with swimming pools, splash pads, hot tubs, saunas, and
steam rooms must take additional steps to ensure those facilities are
properly cleaned and disinfected for visitor use, according to CDC
guidelines.
•Facilities with an openly accessible outdoor hot tub must ensure that at
least six feet of distancing is maintained at all times between hot tub
users not from the same household or limit its use to one household group
at a time.
oGuests should remove face coverings while they are in the hot tub,
due to the likelihood they will become wet, but must wear them as
required when outside of the hot tub.
oFacilities should provide a receptacle for collection of used towels for
laundry, and clean and disinfect high touch surfaces regularly.
oPost signage regarding distancing and face covering requirements.
14
----------------Page (13) Break----------------
oFacility staff must monitor compliance with distancing requirements
and, if it is not possible to consistently maintain distancing, must
discontinue use of the hot tub.
•Hot tub operations with individual, private outdoor hot tubs for hire must
limit their use to one household group at a time.
oGuests should remove face coverings while they are in the hot tub,
due to the likelihood they will become wet, but must wear them as
required when outside of the hot tub.
oPost signage regarding face covering requirements.
oBetween hot tub uses, operators should collect any used towels for
laundry. Clean and disinfect high touch surfaces.
•For indoor pools, face coverings must be worn when out of the water or
shower areas, unless exempt from the CDPH guidance. Cloth face
coverings can be difficult to breathe through when they are wet. Face
coverings should be put away when not in use so they are not accidentally
touched or picked up by others.
•For outdoor pools, face coverings must be worn when out of the water,
unless exempt under the CDPH guidance.
•Maintain proper disinfectant levels (1-10 parts per million free chlorine or 3-
8 ppm bromine) and pH (7.2-8).
•Consult with the company or engineer that designed the aquatic venue to
decide which List N disinfectants approved by the EPA are best for the
aquatic venue. Ensure the safe and correct use and storage of
disinfectants, including storing products securely away from children.
•Set up a system so that furniture and equipment (e.g., lounge chairs) that
needs to be cleaned and disinfected is kept separate from furniture that
has already been cleaned and disinfected. Label containers for used
equipment that has not yet been cleaned and disinfected and containers
for cleaned and disinfected equipment.
•Launder towels and clothing according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Use the warmest appropriate water temperature and dry items
completely. Handle towels with disposable gloves and minimal
disturbance, i.e., do not shake them.
•Discourage people from sharing items, particularly those that are difficult to
clean and disinfect or those that are meant to come in contact with the
face (e.g., goggles, nose clips, and snorkels).
•Ensure that the facility has adequate equipment for guests, such as kick
boards, pool noodles, and other flotation devices, to minimize sharing
15
----------------Page (14) Break----------------
wherever possible. Clean and disinfect the items after each use. 
•For indoor aquatic venues, introduce and circulate outdoor air as much as
possible by opening windows and doors, using fans, or other methods.
However, do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety risk to
workers, visitors, or swimmers.
•Change the deck layout and other areas surrounding the pool to ensure
that the standing and seating areas can support physical distancing
requirements. This could include removing lounge chairs or taping off areas
to discourage use.
•Provide physical cues or guides (e.g., lane lines in the water or chairs and
tables on the deck) and visual cues (e.g., tape on the decks, floors, or
sidewalks) and signs to ensure that workers, visitors, and swimmers stay at
least six feet apart from one another, both in and out of the water.
•Where feasible, install impermeable physical barriers such as Plexiglas
where workers and patrons must interact and physical distancing is difficult.
•Consider implementing reservations for pool use or implementing other
mechanisms to support at least of six feet of physical distancing. This could
include reserving full-lanes for individual lap swimming, maintain swimmers
in alternating lanes, and half-lanes for individual household use.
•Ensure that lifeguards who are actively lifeguarding are not also expected
to monitor handwashing, use of cloth face coverings, or physical
distancing. Assign this monitoring responsibility to another worker.
•Aquatic venues should avoid activities that promote group gatherings and
should be aware of state and local policies on youth and adult sports and
gathering requirements to determine if aquatic fitness classes, swim lessons,
swim team practices, swim meets, or pool parties can be held.
•CDC’s Model Aquatic Health Code has more recommendations to
prevent illness and injuries at public pools.
1 Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. The hotel, lodging, 
and short term rental industries must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to 
adhere to its guidance as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC)and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers should
be prepared to alter their operations as those guidelines change.
