INDUSTRY 
GUIDANCE: 
Restaurants, Bars, and 
Wineries 
July 29, 2020 
All guidance should be implemented 
only with county health officer approval 
following their review of local 
epidemiological data including cases 
per 100,000 population, rate of test 
positivity, and local preparedness to 
support a health care surge, vulnerable 
populations, contact tracing, and 
testing. 1

OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at 
home to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that 
may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with 
serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are 
at higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely 
when people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected 
person, even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed 
symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available 
at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating 
that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of 
these workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken 
to ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not
required) and customers/clients,
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This   document   provides   guidance   for   restaurants,   brewpubs,   craft   distilleries, 
breweries, bars, pubs, and wineries (referred to collectively as “restaurants, bars, and 
wineries”) to support a safe, clean environment for workers and customers. 
NOTE: Restaurants, bars, and wineries are encouraged to continue takeout 
and delivery service whenever possible. Venues that are currently authorized 
to sell beer, wine, and spirits to be consumed off premises should follow the 
guidance for retail. Producers of beer, wine, and spirits should follow the 
guidance for manufacturing. Restaurants, bars, and wineries that have game 
operations such as bowling alleys, pool tables, etc. should follow the

guidance for family entertainment centers. This guidance is not intended for 
concert, performance, or entertainment venues. Restaurants, bars, and 
wineries must discontinue this type of entertainment until these types of 
activities are allowed to resume modified or full operation. All events or 
gatherings that would bring together persons from different households, such 
as private parties, must be cancelled or postponed until further notice. 
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to
public health guidance and state/local orders as the COVID-19 situation continues. 
Cal/OSHA has more comprehensive guidance on their Cal/OSHA General Guidelines 
on Protecting Workers from COVID-19 webpage. The U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration has guidance for restaurants and the CDC has additional 
considerations for restaurants and bars. 
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution
to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance;
•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no
passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering requirements 
in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. 
3
----------------Page (2) Break----------------
 
 
    
     
  
 
 
 
 
    
 
    
Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the 
reasonable cost of obtaining them. 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one of 
the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot 
wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if 
feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude 
any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying 
with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these 
exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Workplace Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at 
every location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work 
areas and work tasks, and designate a person at each establishment to 
implement the plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions . 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
operation is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers or customers. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the establishment for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as 
needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace 
has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) 
and close contacts. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
Topics for Worker Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to 
contracting the virus. 
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks 
using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work: 
o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, 
such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty

breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of 
taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea, OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR 
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone 
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered 
potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 10 
days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms have 
improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of fever 
reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without symptoms 
who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only if 10 days 
have passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 test. 
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including 
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible 
to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or 
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time 
(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not 
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or 
discarded after each shift. 
• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings

must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, 
and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face 
coverings. Training should also include the employer’s policies on how 
people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will be 
handled. 
• Ensure any independent contractors, temporary or contract workers, 
and volunteers at the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 
prevention policies and have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these 
responsibilities ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary 
and/or contract workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive 
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional 
information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers’ 
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under 
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the Governor’s Executive 
Order N-51-20, and workers’ rights to workers’ compensation benefits 
and presumption of the work-relatedness of COVID-19 pursuant to the 
Governor’s Executive order N-62-20 while that Order is in effect. 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers 
entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom 
screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible. 
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to 
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed 
prior to the worker leaving home for their shift and follows CDC 
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. 
• Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to 
stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to 
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples 
are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling 
commonly touched items. Workers should wear gloves when handling 
items contaminated by body fluids. 
• Servers, bussers, bartenders, and other workers moving items used by 
customers (i.e., dirty cups, plates, napkins, etc.) or handling trash bags 
should use disposable gloves (and wash hands before putting them on

and after removing them) and aprons and that are changed frequently. 
• Dishwashers should use equipment to protect the eyes, nose, and mouth 
from contaminant splash using protective glasses, goggles, or a face 
shield in addition to a face covering. Dishwashers must be provided 
impermeable aprons and change them frequently. Reusable protective 
equipment such as shields and glasses should be properly disinfected 
between uses. 
• Establishments must take reasonable measures, including posting signage 
at all entrances and in strategic and highly-visible locations and in 
reservation confirmations, to remind the public that they must use face 
coverings while not eating and drinking and practice physical 
distancing, and should to frequently wash their hands with soap for at 
least 20 seconds,  use hand sanitizer, and not touch their face. 
• Remind guests in advance to bring a face covering and make them 
available to anyone who arrives without one, if possible. 
• Guests and visitors should be screened for temperature and/or symptoms 
upon arrival, asked to use hand sanitizer, and to wear a face covering 
when not eating or drinking. Employers have the right to cancel 
reservations for individuals/parties with symptomatic guests. 
• Display a set of clearly visible rules for customers and personnel at 
entrance(s) that are to be a condition of entry. The rules could include 
instructions to use hand sanitizer, maintain physical distance from other 
customers, avoid unnecessary touching of restaurant surfaces, contact 
information for the local health department, and changes to services. 
Whenever possible, the rules should be available digitally, include 
pictograms, and included on/with menus. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas, such as customer waiting 
areas and lobbies, break rooms, lunch areas and areas of ingress and 
egress including host stands, entry ways, stairways, stairwells, escalators, 
handrails, and elevator controls. Frequently disinfect commonly used 
surfaces including doors, door handles, crash bars, light switches, waiting 
area chairs, credit card terminals, ATM PIN pads, receipt trays, bus tubs, 
serving trays, phones, toilets, vehicle keys, and handwashing facilities. 
• Frequently clean items touched by patrons, especially those that might 
attract contact from children including candy and toy vending 
machines, arcade games, decorative fish tanks, display cases, 
decorative fountains, etc.

• Clean touchable surfaces between shifts or between users, whichever is 
more frequent, including but not limited to working surfaces, phones, 
registers, touchpads/touchscreens, tablets, time clocks, appliances, 
kitchen and bar utensils and implements, oven doors, grill and range 
knobs, carts and trolleys, keys, etc. 
• Avoid sharing audio equipment, phones, tablets, laptops, desks, pens, 
and other work supplies wherever possible. Never share PPE. 
• Discontinue shared use of audio headsets and other equipment between 
workers unless the equipment can be properly disinfected after use. 
Consult equipment manufacturers to determine appropriate disinfection 
steps, particularly for soft, porous surfaces such as foam earmuffs. 
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their 
shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as 
part of the workers’ job duties. 
• Procure options for third-party cleaning companies to assist with the 
increased cleaning demand, as needed. 
• Equip spaces such as dining and tasting rooms, bar areas, host stands, 
and kitchens with proper sanitation products, including hand sanitizer 
and sanitizing wipes for all staff directly assisting customers. 
• Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times 
and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when 
needed. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use products 
approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. Use 
disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, 
diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), 
or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the 
surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, 
manufacturer’s directions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA 
requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should 
wear gloves and other protective equipment as required by the product 
instructions. Follow the asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended 
by the California Department of Public Health and ensure proper 
ventilation. 
• Continue to follow existing codes regarding requirements for sanitizing 
(rather than disinfecting) food contact surfaces. 
• To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases 
associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and 
features are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown.

• Restaurants, bars, and wineries should increase fresh air circulation by 
opening windows or doors, if possible and in accordance with security 
and safety protocols. 
• Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that 
can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter 
wherever possible. 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the 
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other 
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in all 
working areas. 
• Provide menus via alternative, low-touch methods, if possible, such as 
disposable paper menus, non-touch chalk or white boards, and digital 
menus that customers can view on a personal electronic device. Provide 
disposable order numbers/table trackers if possible. If alternatives cannot 
be provided, properly disinfect menus, order numbers, etc. before and 
after customer use. Consider options that allow customers to order 
ahead of time. 
• Discontinue pre-setting tables with napkins, cutlery, glassware, food ware, 
etc. These should be supplied individually to customers as needed. Do 
not leave card stands, flyers, napkin holders, or other items on tables. 
• Suspend use of shared food items such as condiment bottles, salt and 
pepper shakers, etc. and provide these foods in single serve containers, if 
possible. Where this is not possible, shared items such as condiment 
bottles, shakers, etc., should be supplied as needed to customers and 
disinfected after each use. 
• Pre-roll utensils in napkins prior to use by customers. Workers must wash 
hands before pre-rolling utensils in napkins. The pre-roll should then be 
stored in a clean container. After customers are seated, the pre-roll 
should be put on the table by a worker who recently washed their 
hands. 
• Reusable customer items including utensils, food ware, breadbaskets, 
etc., must be properly washed, rinsed, and sanitized. Cleaned flatware, 
stemware, dishware, etc., must be properly stored away from customers 
and personnel until ready for use. Use disposable items if proper cleaning 
of reusable items is infeasible. 
• Takeout containers must be filled by customers and available only upon 
request. 
• Dirty linens used at dining tables such as tablecloths and napkins should 
be removed after each customer use and transported from dining areas 
in sealed bags. Workers should wear gloves when handling dirty linens.

• Thoroughly clean each customer dining/drinking location after every 
use. This will include disinfecting tables, chairs, booster seats, highchairs, 
booths, etc. and allowing adequate time for proper disinfection, 
following product instructions. Environmental Protection Agency-
approved disinfectants require a minimum contact time (seconds to 
minutes) to be effective against human coronavirus. 
• Consider using disposable seat covers, particularly on porous surfaces. 
Discard and replace seat covers between each use. Provide disposable 
or washable covers on pillows used in seating areas and change/wash 
them after each use. 
• Close areas where customers may congregate or touch food or food 
ware items that other guests may use. Modify delivery of these items by 
providing items to guests individually, converting to cafeteria-style 
service, etc. Discard or clean, disinfect, or sanitize shared items after 
each use, as appropriate. The areas that should be closed include but 
are not limited to: 
o Self-service areas with condiment caddies, utensil caddies, napkins, 
lids, straws, water pitchers, to-go containers, etc. 
o Self-service machines including ice, soda, frozen yogurt dispensers, 
etc. 
o Self-service food areas such as buffets, salsa bars, salad bars, snack 
areas, etc. 
• Discontinue tableside food preparation and presentation such as food 
item selection carts and conveyor belts, guacamole preparation, etc. 
• Do not leave out after-meal mints, candies, snacks, or toothpicks for 
customers in self-service receptacles. Offer them with the check or 
provide only on request. 
• Install hand sanitizer dispensers, touchless if possible, at guest and worker 
entrances and contact areas such as driveways, reception areas, in 
dining rooms, near elevator landings, throughout tasting and drinking 
areas, etc. 
• Consider discontinuing use of shared entertainment items that are 
difficult to properly clean and disinfect such as board games, books, etc. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Prioritize outdoor seating and curbside pickup to minimize cross flow of 
customers in enclosed environments. Restaurants, bars, and wineries can 
expand their outdoor seating if they comply with local laws and

regulations. 
• Consider providing takeout, delivery, and drive through options for 
customers whenever possible. Takeout items should be made available 
using contactless pick-up and delivery protocols. 
• Eliminate person-to-person contact for delivery of goods whenever 
possible. Designate drop-off locations to receive deliveries away from 
high traffic areas. Maintain physical distance of at least six feet with 
delivery drivers. 
• Encourage reservations and appointments when possible to allow for 
time to disinfect eating and drinking areas. 
• Consider allowing customers to order ahead of time to limit the amount 
of time spent in the establishment. Ask customers to wait in their cars or 
away from the establishment while waiting to be seated. If possible, alert 
patrons through their mobile phones when their table is ready to avoid 
touching and use of “buzzers.” 
• Adjust maximum occupancy rules inside the establishment based on its 
size to limit the number of people inside and/or use impermeable barriers 
between service tables to protect customers from each other and 
workers. For outdoor seating, maintain physical distancing standards of 
at least six feet and as outlined in this guidance. 
• Limit the number of patrons at a single table to a household unit or 
patrons who have asked to be seated together. People in the same 
group seated at the same table do not have to be six feet apart. 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between workers and customers/single groups. This can include use of 
physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings or signs to indicate 
to where workers and/or guests should stand). 
• Install physical barriers or partitions at cash registers, bars, host stands, 
and other areas where maintaining physical distance of six feet is 
difficult. 
• Any area where guests or workers queue should also be clearly marked 
for appropriate physical distancing. This includes check-stands and 
terminals, deli counters and lines, restrooms, elevator lobbies, host stands 
and waiting areas, valet drop off and pickup, and any other area where 
customers congregate. 
• Establish one-way directional hallways and passageways for foot traffic, if 
possible, to eliminate workers from passing by one another. 
• Guests should enter through doors that are propped open or

must touch door handles. 
• Remove tables and chairs from dining areas so that six feet of physical 
distance can be maintained for customers and workers. If tables, chairs, 
booths, etc., cannot be moved, use visual/physical cues to make them 
unavailable for use or install Plexiglas or other types of impermeable 
physical barriers to minimize exposure between customers. 
• Discontinue seating customers and/or groups at bar counters, sushi 
preparation bars, etc., where they cannot maintain at least six feet of 
distance from work areas/stations. 
• Discontinue open seating. All members of a customer group must be 
present before seating and hosts must bring the entire group to the table 
at one time. Whenever possible, ask guests to be seated rather than 
standing to discourage unnecessary movement. 
• Discourage customers from ordering at the bar and instead usher guests 
directly to their tables. Staff should take and deliver orders to customers 
to limit the number of people moving around shared spaces. If customers 
must order from the bar, reconfigure space so that bartenders, other 
workers, and customers can maintain at least six feet of distance from 
one another. 
• Adjust music volume so that workers can maintain distance from 
customers to hear orders. 
• Implement peak period queueing procedures, including a host to remind 
guests to queue with at least six feet of distance between groups outside 
or in waiting areas. 
• Limit the number of workers serving individual customers or groups, in 
compliance with wage and hour regulations. 
• Encourage the use of credit cards and contactless payment systems. 
• All workers should minimize the amount of time spent within six feet of 
guests. 
• Physical distancing protocols should be used in any office areas, kitchens, 
pantries, walk-in freezers, or other high-density, high-traffic work areas, 
where possible. 
• Worker pre-shift meetings and trainings should be conducted virtually or 
in areas that allow for appropriate physical distancing between workers. 
Food, beverages, food ware, etc., must not be shared. 
• Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, 
to maintain physical distancing protocols.

• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., managing 
inventory rather than working as a cashier or managing administrative 
needs through telework. 
• Reconfigure office spaces, lobbies, beverage bars, kitchens and 
workstations, host stand areas, and other spaces wherever possible to 
allow for at least six feet of distance between people dining, working, 
and passing through areas for entry and exit. 
• Close breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance between 
tables/chairs to separate workers and discourage congregating during 
breaks. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade covers 
and seating that ensures physical distancing. 
• Reconfigure kitchens to maintain physical distancing in those areas 
where practical. Consider doing prep work ahead of time to allow 
staggering of shifts to reduce staff in the kitchen at one time. 
• Discourage food preparation workers from changing or entering others’ 
workstations during shifts. 
• Discourage people from congregating in high traffic areas such as 
bathrooms, hallways, bar areas, reservation and credit card terminals, 
etc. 
• Require workers to avoid handshakes and similar greetings that break 
physical distance. 
• Workers should not open the doors of cars or taxis. 
• If possible, install transfer-aiding materials, such as shelving and bulletin 
boards, to reduce person-to-person hand-offs. 
• Discontinue activities that encourage movement and shared items 
between guests including karaoke singing, open mic performances, trivia 
activities, mixers, pub crawls, etc. 
• Discontinue services and activities that carry an increased risk of 
contamination from sharing and splashing and such as drinking games 
and/or contests, drop shots, etc. 
• Consider limiting excessive consumption of alcohol that could deter 
guests’ compliance with these guidelines. 
• Close dance floors and discontinue performances such as musical or 
dance acts that encourage large gatherings.

Additional Considerations for Tasting Rooms 
• Provide a clean glass for each tasting and, if possible, do not pour 
beverages into a glass that a customer has already used (smelled, tasted 
from, etc.) 
• Discontinue the use of communal dump buckets, spit buckets, spittoons, 
etc. Provide individual, disposable cups to each guest instead to avoid 
splash contamination between guests. 
• Do not touch beverage container necks to cups, glasses, etc., when 
pouring wine, beer, or spirits. 
• Take measures to ensure that tasting group appointment times do not 
overlap to minimize interaction of people from different groups and 
places. 
• Discontinue tours that combine individuals from different households into 
the same tour group. Tour guides must maintain at least six feet of 
physical distance from customers/visitors. 
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Restaurants, bars, 
and wineries must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its 
guidance as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers should be 
prepared to alter their operations as those guidelines change.
