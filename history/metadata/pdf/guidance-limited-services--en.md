OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that 
person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, restaurants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not required)
and customers/clients,
frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus.

PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for limited services which do not generally require 
close customer contact. Limited services include those businesses that can provide 
services while maintaining appropriate physical distancing from customers or the 
public. Businesses in the limited services industry are open across all tiers but must follow 
the modifications in this guidance.  
For the most updated information on county tier status, visit Blueprint for a Safer 
Economy. Please note that local health departments can have more restrictive criteria 
and different closures. Find your county’s local information. 
Examples of limited services businesses include laundromats, dry cleaners, other laundry 
services, auto repair shops, car washes, landscapers, door to door services and sales, 
pet grooming, and dog walking. Additionally, this guidance applies to those businesses 
for which service provision may necessitate entry to private residences or community 
facilities, but physical distance can still be maintained. Those businesses include 
residential and janitorial cleaning services, HVAC services, appliance repair persons, 
electricians, plumbers, other mechanical tradespersons, handypersons, and general 
contractors.  
Business owners or operators must acknowledge that lessees or subcontractors should 
only resume operations when they are ready and able to implement the necessary 
safety measures to provide for their safety and that of their customers. 
NOTE: This guidance is not intended for personal care, in-home healthcare, in- home 
care, assisted living, and personal care services that necessitate close customer 
contact, including hair salons, barbershops, nail salons, massage parlors, aestheticians 
and cosmetology, ear piercing salons, and tattoo parlors. Additional guidance for such 
industries is available on the Industry Guidance to Reduce Risk website. 
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public 
health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. 
Cal/OSHA has comprehensive guidance on their Cal/OSHA Interim General Guidelines 
on Protecting Workers from COVID-19 webpage. CDC has additional requirements in 
their guidance for businesses and employers.

Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. Complete details, 
including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be found in the 
guidance.  
The CDPH Face Covering Guidance is subject to additional updates based on the 
current scientific understanding of transmission of the virus causing COVID-19. Please 
check the CDPH website for any revisions.

----------------Page (3) Break----------------
 Workplace Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every 
location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and 
work tasks, and designate a person at each establishment to implement 
the plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
operation is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers or customers. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the establishment for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as 
needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has 
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines and orders or 
guidance from the local health department. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) and 
close contacts. 
• Notify all employees in writing, and employers of subcontracted 
employees, who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and report 
workplace outbreaks to the local health department. For additional 
information on employer responsibilities under AB 685 (Chapter 84, 
Statutes of 2020), refer to the Enhanced Enforcement and Employer 
Reporting Requirements from Cal/OSHA and the Employer Questions 
about AB 685 from CDPH.  
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
 
Topics for Worker Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
people are at higher risk for severe illness or death. 
5
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
•Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks
using CDC guidelines.
•The importance of not coming to work:
oIf a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, such
as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,
fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell,
sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea,
OR
oIf a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been
released from isolation, OR
oIf, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered
potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation).
•To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only after
meeting CDPH Guidance on Returning to Work or School Following
COVID-19 Diagnosis.
•To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face.
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage.
•The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible
to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). Never use hand sanitizers with
methanol due to its high toxicity to both children and adults.
•The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time
(see Physical Distancing section below).
•Proper use of face coverings, including:
oFace coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE).
oFace coverings do not replace the need for physical distancing and
frequent handwashing.
oFace coverings must cover the nose and mouth.
oWorkers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or
adjusting face coverings.
oAvoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth.
oFace coverings must not be shared and should be washed or
6
----------------Page (5) Break----------------
discarded after each shift. 
•Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings.
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled.
•Ensure any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at
the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and
have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of
time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers.
•Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional
information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers’
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.
•Mechanical tradespeople that work near plumbing vents, HVAC exhaust,
or other type of exhaust fans must be informed that exhaust air could
contain the virus that causes COVID-19 if infected persons are in the
residence or building.
•Mechanical tradespeople that work on sewage, plumbing, and custodial
or janitorial services must be informed that the virus that causes COVID-19
has been found in the feces of some persons with COVID-19.
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
•Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the
beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers
entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom
screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible.
•If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above.
•Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to
stay home.
•Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary.
•Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to
7
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are 
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly 
touched items. 
•Workers who consistently must be within six feet of guests or co-workers
must wear a secondary barrier (e.g., face shield or safety goggles) in
addition to a face covering. All workers should minimize the amount of
time spent within six feet of customers.
•Mechanical tradespeople working near plumbing vents and rooftop
HVAC exhaust, or other types of exhaust fans in residences and buildings,
must be provided and use a face shield and a NIOSH-approved
particulate respirator. If respirators are not available, an ASTM-rated
surgical mask must be used.
•Mechanical tradespeople working on sewage plumbing must be
provided and use a face shield and an impermeable face cover. If the
work may disperse sewage droplets into the air (such as sewer drain
snaking), a NIOSH-approved particulate respirator, if available, is
required.
•Employers must take reasonable measures, including public address
announcements, posting signage in strategic and highly-visible locations,
and in reservation confirmations, to remind the public that they must use
face coverings whenever not eating or drinking, practice physical
distancing, not touch their face, frequently wash their hands with soap
and water for at least 20 seconds, and use hand sanitizer.
Ventilation, Cleaning, and Disinfecting 
Protocols  
•Where possible, install portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrade the
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and make other
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in all
working areas.
•Check the CDPH website periodically for updates on indoor air quality
and ventilation guidance for airborne diseases in indoor settings.
•Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas such as reception areas,
waiting rooms and lobbies, front desk check-in areas, break rooms and
lunch areas, changing areas, and areas of ingress and egress including
stairways, stairwells, and handrails. Frequently disinfect commonly used
surfaces including credit card terminals, counters, door handles, light
switches, phones, toilets, and handwashing facilities.
•Regularly clean and sanitize shared equipment, including but not limited
8
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
to time clocks, landline phones, handles, hoses, spray nozzles, washers 
and dryers, any machinery or tools, and any other equipment between 
each use or when it is transferred to a new customer or worker. 
•Avoid sharing phones, tablets, laptops, desks, pens, other work supplies,
wherever possible. Never share PPE.
•All dirty linens should be placed in a covered, non-porous container and
washed at a high temperature and cleaned in accordance with CDC
guidelines. All properly cleaned linens should be stored in closed cabinet
or covered shelving until used. Ensure workers performing this function
have the proper protective equipment.
•Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their
shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as
part of the workers’ job duties.
•Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times
and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when
needed. Provide additional sanitary facilities, where feasible, if several
workers need to use the restroom at the same time, e.g., during
scheduled breaks.
•To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases
associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and
features are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown.
•Place signage in workspace and common areas, including lobbies,
waiting rooms, and reception areas, emphasizing basic infection
prevention measures, including posting hand-washing signs in restrooms.
•When choosing disinfecting chemicals, use products approved for use
against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-
approved list and follow product instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to
be effective against emerging viral pathogens, diluted household bleach
solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or alcohol solutions with at
least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the surface. Provide workers
training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer’s directions, ventilation
requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers using
cleaners or disinfectants must wear gloves and other protective
equipment as required by the product instructions. Follow the asthma-
safer cleaning methods recommended by the California Department of
Public Health and ensure proper ventilation.
•Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that
can disperse pathogens into the air unless all persons in the area have
appropriate PPE. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever possible.

----------------Page (8) Break----------------
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
•WARNING: physical distancing alone is insufficient to prevent transmission
of COVID-19.
•Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet
between and among workers and customers. This can include use of
physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored tape, or
signs to indicate to where workers and/or customers should stand).
•Take measures at customer service desks or other areas where physical
distancing cannot be maintained to minimize exposure between workers
and customers, such as Plexiglas or other barriers.
•Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., managing
inventory rather or managing administrative needs through telework).
•If feasible and appropriate for the business, implement an appointment
system to help with scheduling and reduce walk-in customers. Consider
staggering appointments to reduce reception or waiting area
congestion.
•Consider entry queuing systems that do not disrupt foot traffic or violate
physical distancing requirements. Any area where customers or workers
queue should be clearly marked for appropriate physical distancing.
Alternate entry requirements to facilities should be developed and could
include digital reservations for entry and pre-order guidelines.
•Implement strategies that encourage customers to stay in their cars or
outside the business or residence, where possible. This could include “no- 
contact” pick-up or delivery processes or curbside payment. Designate
drop-off or pick-up locations away from high traffic areas.
•Provide clearly designated entrances and separate exits to help maintain
physical distancing and direct foot traffic, if possible. Wherever possible,
doors should be left open if they do not open and close automatically.
•Stagger shifts, split or rotate work schedules, and stagger worker breaks,
in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to minimize worker
overlap and maintain physical distancing protocols.
•Reconfigure reception and waiting areas, lobbies, workstations, and
worker breakrooms, if possible, to allow for at least six feet of distance
between customers and workers.
•Do not allow people to congregate in high traffic areas such as
bathrooms, hallways, passageways, credit card terminals, etc.
10
----------------Page (9) Break----------------
•Establish directional hallways and passageways for foot traffic, if possible,
to eliminate customers and workers from passing by one another.
•Require workers to avoid handshakes and similar greetings or other
behaviors that break physical distance.
•Hold meetings over the phone or via webinar for workers wherever
possible. When not possible, adjust staff meetings to ensure physical
distancing and use smaller individual meetings at facilities to maintain
physical distancing guidelines.
•Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas to
ensure at least six feet of separation to limit transmission of the virus.
•Ensure workers can maintain physical distance in breakrooms, using
barriers, increasing distance between tables/chairs to separate workers,
etc. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade coverings
and seating arrangements that ensures physical distancing. Discourage
workers from congregating during breaks and ensure they are not eating
or drinking without face coverings within six feet of each other.
Additional Considerations for Services that 
Require Entry to Residential, Commercial, or 
Public Buildings 
•Workers who must enter private residences or commercial or public
buildings to complete their work should be provided personal hand
sanitizer, which should be replenished or restocked by the employer as
needed.
•Contact customers in advance, ideally the day before the appointment
is scheduled, to confirm the appointment and ask if any member of the
household or personnel on-site is exhibiting any symptoms, has been sick
or is currently sick, or whether anyone on the premises has been exposed
to someone who has been sick. If the customer answers in the affirmative
for any of those questions, reschedule the appointment at least 10 to 14
days in the future.
•During the advance call, request customers use face coverings during
the appointment and emphasize the importance of maintaining a safe
distance of at least six feet from the worker entering the residence or
building.
•Develop a process workflow with questions and talking points for workers
to use upon arrival on-site to identify suspected COVID-19 concerns. The
workflow should give workers the flexibility to gauge the situation and
determine whether they can safely enter the residence or building.
11
----------------Page (10) Break----------------
•Allow workers to call a “safety stop” when they are reluctant to enter a
residence or building due to unsafe or unhealthy work conditions related
to COVID-19 hazards. During such situations, workers should call a
supervisor, if feasible, and discuss what work is essential to complete
immediately and proper precautions to take. Based on an evaluation of
the circumstances, supervisors should inform workers if they should not
enter the residence, avoiding workers feeling pressured to make the
ultimate decision. Workers should also be able to make that
determination themselves without fear of reprisal or retaliation.
•Limit exposure for workers who must enter private residences or buildings
by implementing virtual customer service support or service provision,
wherever possible. This could include self-install/repair strategies through
phone consultations or support through video calls and instruction videos,
if possible.
•When working in a private residence, workers should minimize contact
with customers’ personal belongings. Similarly, in commercial or public
buildings, workers should limit their interaction in the facility and avoid
touching surfaces where possible. Where possible, appliances or other
items the worker must touch should be cleaned with disinfecting wipes
prior to and after the service is performed.
•Conduct virtual safety briefings weekly, or as needed, prior to workers
going on service calls and develop internal communications that can be
regularly updated on the use of protective equipment and other
mitigation requirements.
•After completion of work at a residence or building, workers must remove
all PPE and face coverings and wash their hands and face. Face
coverings must be washed before being reused.
Considerations for Homeowners and Building 
Residents 
•Homeowners and residents must postpone all non-emergency, in-home
services if there are any COVID-19 positive persons, persons with COVID-
19 symptoms, or persons under quarantine in the residence.
•For emergency service repairs, homeowners and residents should inform
workers of any COVID-19 positive persons, persons with COVID-19
symptoms, or persons under quarantine in the residence and take
measures to minimize exposure risks to any person entering the home.
These include:
oAiring out the residence if weather permits.
12
----------------Page (11) Break----------------
o Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces in areas where the service person 
may work or need to access. 
o Maintaining physical distancing of at least six feet when letting the 
service worker into the home. 
o Wearing face coverings at all times during the visit, unless unable to 
per the exemption criteria in the CDPH face coverings guidelines. 
o Staying out of the area where the repair person is working. 
 
Additional Considerations for Those Limited 
Services That Operate Out of Vehicles 
• Guidelines for delivery services are available Industry Guidance to 
Reduce Risk site. 
• All work trucks and vehicles must have hand sanitizer available and all 
workers should sanitize their hands when arriving on-site. 
• Provide workers with an adequate supply of materials required to clean 
and disinfect frequently touched surfaces of the delivery vehicle. Provide 
lined trash receptacles to be placed in delivery vehicles to properly 
dispose of disinfectant wipes and other items. 
• Clean and disinfect the cabs of work trucks and vehicles, including 
dashboard controls, steering wheel, gear shift, handles, etc., as well as 
other touch points on the vehicle such as handles and latches. 
• Where alternatives to physical contact with delivery-related items cannot 
be avoided, workers should wipe down and disinfect equipment, pens, 
clipboards, and electronic signature pads after each use when shared 
with customers while performing a delivery. Touch pads and punch keys 
on terminals such as card readers or handheld digital devices must be 
cleaned and disinfected after every transaction. 
• Workers should limit contact with frequently touched surfaces during 
deliveries, such as doorbells or door handles. If possible, avoid contact 
with hands or bare skin when opening doors. 
• Communicate to workers where they can access soap, clean running 
water, and drying materials, and provide alcohol-based hand sanitizers; 
adjust schedules to build in time for frequent handwashing. 
• For workers who make service calls, normally accessible restrooms on 
routes (e.g., restaurants, coffee shops) may be closed. Employers should 
provide workers alternative restroom locations and allow time for workers 
to use them. 
13
----------------Page (12) Break----------------
Additional Considerations for Auto Repair 
Shops 
•Minimize or eliminate use of shared equipment and tools. If tools are
shared, sanitize between each use, according to CDC guidelines.
Sanitize all tools daily after the work day ends.
•Allow for customers to drop off and pick up vehicles after hours using a
“night drop” box or slot to limit personal contact and consider allowing
use of a drop box style system during working hours.
•Request customers to wear face coverings when dropping off the vehicle
and interacting with workers. Request that customers remove personal
items from the vehicle. Customers should be asked not to bring children
or others with them during the vehicle drop-off.
•Discontinue any customer pick-up or drop-off services and ensure
customers know that they are responsible for their own travel to and from
the repair shop.
•Clean touchable surfaces regularly, including tools, handles and latches,
and controls on stationary and mobile equipment.
•If a tow truck or other company vehicle is frequently shared amongst
workers, thoroughly clean the surfaces in the cab whenever a new driver
uses the vehicle.
•Disinfect keys, key fobs, and the vehicle before and after servicing a
customer’s vehicle. Wipe down all surfaces and controls touched by the
driver or technician.
•Communicate with customers via text, email, or phone to  provide
estimates and get repair authorizations. Implement digital vehicle
inspections, where possible, to identify service needs and provide
estimates.
•Consider closing waiting rooms or lounges. If that’s not possible, waiting
rooms or lounges should be reconfigured so that physical distancing can
be maintained, this could include taping off chairs or benches that
should not be used or removing furniture from the room.
14
----------------Page (13) Break----------------
Additional Considerations for Car Washing 
Operations 
•Regularly clean payment terminals, vacuum hoses, bay guns, wash
selector equipment, vending machines, and cleaning machines and
high traffic areas like waiting rooms or lounges.
•Consider requiring customers to make reservations for in-person services
that are not automated, e.g. detailing.
•Request customers to bring and use face coverings during the
appointment and ask that customers remove personal items from the
vehicle. Customers should be asked not to bring children or others with
them for the service.
•Vehicles should be ventilated with a blower and air should be
recirculated through the vehicle before workers clean them to minimize
exposure to air that might contain contaminants.
•Limit interior vehicle cleaning to one worker at a time.
•Ensure vacuum nozzles are cleaned after every use.
•Customers should line up in their cars at facilities with automated car
washing and not exit the vehicle.
•For self-serve car wash operations, remove dirty towels or cloth wipes
after each customer interaction. Place them in a closed container where
they cannot be used again until properly laundered either by a
commercial laundering service or a laundering process which includes
immersion in water of at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 25
minutes. Store all clean linens in a clean, covered place. Ensure workers
who handle dirty linens or laundry wear gloves. Close every other
vacuum stall, if necessary, to maintain physical distancing.
•For self-service car washes, provide disposable gloves for customers to
use when handling hoses, wands, vacuum hoses and other cleaning
devices. Frequently clean and disinfect these surfaces.
•Consider closing waiting rooms or lounges. If that’s not possible, waiting
rooms or lounges should be reconfigured so that physical distancing can
be maintained, this could include taping off chairs or benches that
should not be used or removing furniture from the room.
15
----------------Page (14) Break----------------
Additional Considerations for Cleaning and 
Janitorial Services 
• Minimize or eliminate use of shared equipment and tools. If tools are 
shared, sanitize between each use, according to CDC guidelines. 
Sanitize all tools daily after the work day ends. 
• Janitorial or custodial workers must be told if they are going to be working 
in a location where an infected person has been so they can take the 
necessary precautions to protect themselves and can provide needed 
cleaning and disinfecting services. 
• Any area where an infected person has been must be ventilated, 
according to Table 1 in the Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of 
Mycobacterium Tuberculosis at 99.9% removal efficiency before workers 
can enter. 
• If janitorial or custodial workers are asked to disinfect an area with known 
COVID-19 confirmed cases, they must not start operations until the 
employer has provided the proper protective equipment and hazard 
training, or a refresher training. 
• Make sure all workers have been trained to use and have an adequate 
supply of all-purpose cleaners and disinfectants, when needed. Follow 
the complete CDC guidelines for cleaning and disinfection. 
• Follow Cal/OSHA requirements and manufacturer instructions for safe use 
and required personal protective equipment for cleaning products. 
• Workers should have enough ventilation (air flow) in areas where they are 
disinfecting. If cleaning in a bathroom or other small space, make sure 
the door is propped open. Follow the safer cleaning methods 
recommended by the California Department of Health Services. 
• Workers should be supplied with bandages or other items to cover any 
cuts, scratches, or open wounds on skin and have sufficient supply to 
change the bandages often. 
• Customers must be reminded to maintain at least six feet of distance from 
janitorial or custodial staff. Implement a process to regularly check in with 
workers to ensure customers are following this protocol. Ensure workers 
are able to share such information without fear of reprisal or retaliation.  
16
----------------Page (15) Break----------------
Additional Considerations for Pet Grooming 
and Dog Walking 
•Pet grooming services should evaluate their existing cleaning and
sanitation protocols and determine what additional hygiene and
cleaning measures should be implemented. All items and equipment,
including tables, baths, and grooming tools, should be thoroughly
cleaned and disinfected between each pet appointment.
•Pet grooming services should require customers to make reservations for
in-person services and walk-in appointments should be suspended.
Appointments should be staggered, where feasible, to limit customer
interactions.
•Pet grooming services should require pets be dropped off for their
appointment through a contactless process instead of hand-to-hand
delivery, when possible. This could include curbside check-in and pick-
up, where feasible.
•Pets should be transferred to and from their grooming services with slip
leads owned by the pet grooming facility. The pet grooming facility
should not handle anything belonging to pets, including collars and
leashes.
•To help keep six feet of distance between people at all possible times,
place tape on the grooming room floors and in areas indicating where
customers should stand and where groomers can walk. Pet groomers
should be instructed to maintain a distance of at least six feet between
themselves and any person, including fellow groomers.
•Limit the total number of groomers in the grooming facility, consistent with
physical distancing requirements, instructing groomers to work at every
other table and limit only one groomer at a time in the pet bathing area.
•Dog walking services should establish protocols to ensure customers
cancel their dog walking service if any person in the household has been
diagnosed with COVID-19 or is sick or exhibiting any symptoms.
•Dog walking services should maintain regular contact with customers to
ask about any such issues if not told by the customer in advance. If the
dog walker or pet owner has any COVID-19 symptoms, has been sick, or
has been exposed to someone who has, dog walking services should be
cancelled.
•Dog walkers and pet owners should keep their interactions limited. If
unable to discuss important pet care details virtually, in-person interaction
must be short and a six-foot distance throughout any conversation must
be maintained.

•Dog walkers and pet owners should practice contactless hand-offs. The
pet owner should make all efforts to allow the dog walker to let
themselves in and all essential materials should be left near the door.
•If a lead hand-off is necessary, keep the interaction quick and wash
hands after or use proper hand sanitizer.
•When the pet owner is not home, they should make sure the pet is easily
accessible and should gate the pet near the entry area whenever
possible.
•If the pet owner is dropping the dog off at the dog walker’s residence,
the dog walker should ensure the drop-off occurs at the home’s door or,
in a multi-family building, an established common area, preferably
outdoors.
•When possible, the dog walker should bring and use their own lead and
disposable waste bags. Clean and sanitize all materials, including leads,
food containers, water, and food bowls before and after a walk.
Additional Considerations for Landscaping 
and Yard Maintenance Services 
•Minimize or eliminate use of shared equipment and tools. If tools are
shared, sanitize between each use, according to CDC guidelines.
Sanitize all tools daily after the work day ends.
•Avoid contact with touch points at the jobsite, such as gate handles, and
ensure any employer-provided equipment is disinfected before use
(mowers, hoses, etc.).
•Whenever possible, workers should drive separately to job sites, only one
person per vehicle, unless a vehicle is large enough to maintain social
distancing.
•If workers meet at a central location and travel to job site in company- 
owned vehicles, assign one truck to one crew and do not rotate the
vehicle. The vehicle cab and all touch points should be cleaned at the
end of each work day.
•Eliminate customer contact whenever possible. When customers are
present, maintain six-foot social distance at all times. Announce yourself
by phone instead of ringing the doorbell. Take payment over the phone
or online, if possible.

Additional Considerations for Laundromats, 
Dry Cleaning, and Other Laundry Services 
•This guidance does not include product handling hazards in laundromats
that process biologically contaminated laundry from health care
institutions. Additional requirements apply to those facilities.
•All garments should be handled using extra precautions. Garments
should be brought in a sealed bag and left sealed for at least 24 hours
and handled as little as possible.
•Workers should avoid shaking the garments once they are removed from
the bag. Workers should wear disposable gloves and wash hands before
wearing and after removing them.
•Disinfect counters, pay terminals, and other commonly touched items
between each customer visit.
•Limit the total number of customers in laundromats to ensure physical
distancing can be maintained. This could also require that some washing
and drying machines are made inoperable to ensure customers have
adequate distance when using the machines.
•If linens are to be transported on routes, any containers used to transport
clean linens, if previously used for soiled linens, must be properly cleaned
and disinfected. Containers need to be labeled appropriately.
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Limited service 
providers must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance 
as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the 
California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers should be prepared to 
alter their operations as those guidelines change.
