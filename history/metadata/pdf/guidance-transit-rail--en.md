COVID-19 
INDUSTRY 
GUIDANCE: 
Public and Private 
Passenger Carriers, 
Transit, and Intercity 
Passenger Rail
October 20, 2020
This guidance is designed to address 
sectors and activities opening statewide. 
However, local health officers may 
implement more stringent rules tailored 
to local epidemiological conditions, so 
employers should also confirm relevant 
local opening policies.

OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population.  
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that 
person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, restaurants, and grocery stores.  
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public.  
Key prevention practices include: 
physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not required)
and customers/clients,
frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus.

PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for public and private passenger carriers (e.g. shuttle 
providers, taxis, and rideshare operators), transit agencies, California state-supported 
intercity passenger rail operators (Capitol Corridor, San Joaquins, and Pacific Surfliner), 
and passenger vessel operations. The guidance is intended to support a safe, clean 
environment for workers and customers. Businesses in this industry are open across all 
tiers but must follow the modifications in this guidance. 
For the most updated information on county tier status, visit Blueprint for a Safer 
Economy. Please note that local health departments can have more restrictive criteria 
and different closures. Find your county’s local information. 
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Additionally, it is not intended to 
conflict with federal or state requirements for rail or transit vehicles or facilities. Stay 
current on changes to public health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 
situation continues. Cal/OSHA has more comprehensive guidance on their Cal/OSHA 
Interim General Guidelines on Protecting Workers from COVID-19 webpage. CDC has 
specific guidelines for the transit industry: 
•Bus Transit Operators
•Rail Transit Operators
•Transit Maintenance Workers
•Transit Station Workers
•Rideshare, Taxi, Limo and Other Drivers-for-Hire
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure.  
The CDPH Face Covering Guidance is subject to additional updates based on the 
current scientific understanding of transmission of the virus causing COVID-19. Please 
check the CDPH website for any revisions.

Worksite Specific Plan 
•Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every
location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and
work tasks, and designate a person at each establishment to implement
the plan.
•Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions.
•Identify contact information for the local health department where the
operation is located for communicating information about COVID-19
outbreaks among workers or customers.
•Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives.
•Regularly evaluate the establishment for compliance with the plan and
document and correct deficiencies identified.
•Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as
needed to prevent further cases.
•Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines and orders or guidance
from the local health department.
•Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) and
close contacts.
•Notify all employees in writing, and employers of subcontracted
employees, who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and report
workplace outbreaks to the local health department. For additional
information on employer responsibilities under AB 685 (Chapter 84, Statutes
of 2020), refer to the Enhanced Enforcement and Employer Reporting
Requirements from Cal/OSHA and the Employer Questions about AB 685
from CDPH. 
•Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited.

----------------Page (3) Break----------------
Topics for Worker Training 
•Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which
people are at higher risk for severe illness or death.
•Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks
using CDC guidelines.
•The importance of not coming to work:
oIf a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, such
as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,
fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell,
sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea,
OR
oIf a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been
released from isolation, OR
oIf, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered
potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation).
•To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only
after meeting CDPH Guidance on Returning to Work or School
Following COVID-19 Diagnosis.
•To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face.
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage.
•The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible
to children) when workers cannot get to a sink or handwashing station,
per CDC guidelines). Never use hand sanitizers with methanol due to its
high toxicity to both children and adults.
•The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time
(see Physical Distancing section below).
•Proper use of face coverings, including:
oFace coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE).
oFace coverings do not replace the need for physical distancing and
frequent handwashing.
oFace coverings must cover the nose and mouth.
5
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
oWorkers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or
adjusting face coverings.
oAvoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth.
oFace coverings must not be shared and should be washed or
discarded after each shift.
oThe importance of passengers wearing face coverings and that the
operator has the right to cancel reservations for passengers not
wearing them.
•Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules,
and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face
coverings. Training should also include the employer’s policies on how
people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will be
handled.
•Ensure any independent contractors, temporary or contract workers, and
volunteers at the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention
policies and have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these
responsibilities ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary
and/or contract workers.
•Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional
information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers’
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
•Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the
beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers
entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom
screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible.
•If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above.
•Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to
stay home.
6
----------------Page (5) Break----------------
•Workers should provide and ensure workers use all required protective
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary.
•Workers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly
touched items.
•Individuals entering a facility should be restricted to only those classified
as essential by management and they must complete a temperature
and/or symptom screening before entering.
•Public and private passenger carriers, transit, vessel, and/or rail agencies
and entities must take reasonable measures to remind the public that
they must use face coverings (unless exempted per the CDPH Face
Covering Guidance), practice physical distancing, and avoid directly
facing other passengers when physical distancing is difficult. They should
also communicate any updated ridership practices and any changes to
the frequency of service timetables to the public. Public communication
could include those listed (above) and may also include updates to text
messaging or transit apps.
•Taxis, rideshare, shuttle, limousine, and other passenger transit operators
should take steps to ensure customers are fully aware of the company’s
new policies and procedures when using the riding service. Passengers
must be notified before booking a ride that they must use face coverings
(unless exempted per the CDPH Face Covering Guidance) and that the
operator has the right to cancel reservations for passengers not wearing
them.
•Where feasible, taxi and rideshare drivers should be provided a supply of
face coverings to give to passengers who arrive for a ride service without
them.
Ventilation, Cleaning, and Disinfecting 
Protocols  
•Where possible, install portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrade the
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and make other
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in
vehicles, offices, break areas, and other indoor spaces.
•Check the CDPH website periodically for updates on indoor air quality
and ventilation guidance for airborne diseases in indoor settings.
•Perform thorough cleaning on high traffic areas within transit and rail
stations, in transit and rail vehicles, and water transport vessels like ferries
7
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
and boats, on a regular basis. Areas could include break rooms, restroom 
surfaces, lunch areas, changing areas and areas of ingress and egress, 
including stairways, handrails, and elevator controls, etc. Frequently 
disinfect commonly used surfaces, including kiosks, ticket machines, 
turnstiles, benches, elevator buttons, system maps, doorknobs, toilets, 
handwashing facilities, equipment handles, maintenance equipment, 
and tools. 
• Perform routine cleaning and disinfection of all frequently touched 
surfaces within all vehicles used to transport passengers, including but not 
limited to, seats, arm rests, door handles, seat belt buckles, light and air 
controls, walls and windows, grab handles, pull-cords and buttons used 
by riders to request a stop. 
• Clean all areas of drivers’ cabs between shifts or users, whichever is more 
frequent. Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during 
their shifts. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours 
as part of the worker’s job duties. 
• When assisting passengers using a wheelchair or other mobility device, or 
who require operator assistance, operators must sanitize their hands 
before and after the interaction.  
• Avoid sharing phones, other work tools, or equipment wherever possible. 
Never share PPE. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, use products approved for use 
against COVID-19 listed on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-
approved list and follow product instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to 
be effective against emerging viral pathogens, diluted household bleach 
solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or alcohol solutions with at 
least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the surface. Provide workers 
training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer’s directions, ventilation 
requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers using 
cleaners or disinfectants must wear gloves and other protective 
equipment as required by the product. Follow the asthma-safer cleaning 
methods recommended by the California Department of Public Health 
and ensure there is sufficient ventilation. 
• To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases 
associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and 
features (e.g., drinking fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility 
shutdown. 
• Equip stations, transit and rail offices, transit and rail vehicles, and 
passenger vehicles with proper sanitation products, including hand 
sanitizer and disinfecting wipes, and provide personal hand sanitizers to 
all frontline staff (e.g., operators and drivers). 
8
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
•Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times
and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when
needed.
•Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that
can disperse pathogens into the air unless all persons in the area have
appropriate PPE. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever possible.
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
•WARNING: physical distancing alone is insufficient to prevent transmission
of COVID-19.
•Reduce maximum occupancy onboard transit and rail vehicles and
vessels to support physical distancing. Remove or space seats to support
physical distancing or use colored tape to mark the seats that riders are
allowed to use or block off seats that are not to be used. Where possible,
use additional buses or transit vehicles to support excess capacity on
busy lines and ensure physical distancing of passengers.
•Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet
between transit and rail operators and passengers. This can include use
of physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored tape,
taking passenger seats or spaces out of service, or signs to indicate to
passengers where they should not sit or stand near the bus operator). If
seating is taken out of service, be mindful of ensuring compliance with
minimum requirements for handicapped-accessible seating.
•In public transit vehicles, for example city busses, seats within six feet of
the operator should be blocked off and unavailable to passengers if it
does not impact the requirements for handicapped-accessible seating.
Operators will have the option to request passengers avoid standing or
sitting within six feet of them. Where possible, install Plexiglas or other
appropriate barriers in transit and rail vehicles to minimize exposure
between operators and passengers.
•Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., managing
administrative needs through telework).
•Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to
maintain physical distancing protocols.
•Ensure workers can maintain physical distance in breakrooms, using
barriers, increasing distance between tables/chairs to separate workers,
etc. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade coverings
and seating arrangements that ensures physical distancing. Discourage
9
----------------Page (8) Break----------------
workers from congregating during breaks and ensure they are not eating 
or drinking without face coverings within six feet of each other. 
•Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas
to ensure at least six feet of separation to limit transmission of the virus.
•Require passengers to purchase tickets and add value to transit and rail
cards online to minimize the need for use of machines at the station.
•Develop a passenger entry and exit plan to minimize physical contact
and crowding with other passengers during entry and exit of the transit
vehicle.
•When traveling by a water transport vessel, such as a ferry or boat, ask
the passengers to indicate to a crew member if they are traveling
together as party, if feasible. The crew will help passengers queue for
boarding and disembarking the vessel in physically distanced small
groups.
•Track the routes on which physical distancing is a challenge due to
ridership. Adjust bus or transit routes and scheduling to account for the
need for additional busses, trains, and other transit vehicles during peak
ridership hours on busy routes.
Additional Considerations for Passenger 
Carriers (Taxis, Rideshare Vehicles, Shuttles, 
Limousines, etc.) 
•Pooled rides offered by ridesharing companies, which includes providing
a carpool type of option for different parties traveling in a similar
direction, should be suspended until further public health guidance is
provided for restarting such rides.
•Taxi and rideshare operators and private transit companies should
develop a process that permits both drivers and riders to cancel rides
without penalty if the other party is not wearing a face covering. This
policy should be communicated to passengers before they book a ride.
•Provide drivers with an adequate supply of materials required to clean
and disinfect frequently touched surfaces of the vehicle. Drivers should
have cleaning and disinfecting spray and/or disposable wipes in their
vehicles. Drivers should follow manufacturer’s directions for proper
cleaning and disinfecting in the vehicle, including using cleaning
techniques appropriate for the surface. Drivers should be instructed on
the hazards of the product(s) and any necessary protective measures.
Ensure adequate ventilation when cleaning/disinfecting vehicles. The
10
----------------Page (9) Break----------------
steering wheel, gear shift, signal levers, and other commonly-touched 
vehicle parts should be regularly cleaned and disinfected. Provide lined 
trash receptacles to be placed in the vehicle to properly dispose of 
disinfectant wipes and other items. 
•High-touch areas within the vehicle frequently touched by passengers
should be frequently cleaned and disinfected at the beginning and end
of each shift, and between transporting passengers. This includes the
door frame, handles, windows, seatbelt buckles, and trunk latch. Provide
time for workers to implement cleaning practices between transporting
passengers. If cleaning is assigned to the driver they must be
compensated for that time.
•Consider installing an impermeable barrier between the front and rear
seats.
•Drivers should consider asking passengers to handle their own personal
bags and belongings during pick-up and drop-off, if possible. If providing
such services, request that the passengers maintain a minimum of six feet
distance. After touching passenger belongings, drivers should use hand
sanitizer.
•Riders should sit in the back seat to maximize distance between the
passenger and the driver. Rideshare apps should remind passengers of
this updated requirement and the number of available seats when
making a request for a vehicle and through emails, texts, or other
customer communication tools.
•Rideshare and taxi apps and taxi phone operators should remind
passengers to wear face coverings and notify them that the ride may be
cancelled if they do not wear a face covering.
•Avoid using the recirculated air option for the vehicle’s ventilation during
passenger transport; where possible, use the vehicle’s vents to bring in
outside air and/or lower the vehicle windows.
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Public and private 
passenger carriers, transit agencies, and intercity passenger rail operators must comply with all 
Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as guidance from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public 
Health (CDPH). Additionally, these entities must be prepared to alter their operations as those 
guidelines change.
