OVERVIEW 
The following guidance is intended to help day camps formulate and implement plans 
for safe re-opening.  
These recommendations depend on community monitoring to prevent COVID-19 from 
spreading. Communities with adequate surveillance and lower incidence and spread 
of COVID-19 may put in place the practices described below as part of a phased 
reopening. All decisions about following these recommendations should be made in 
collaboration with local health officials and other authorities, and should depend on 
the levels of COVID-19 community transmission and the capacities of the local public 
health and healthcare systems, among other relevant factors.  
Implementation of these guidelines should be tailored for each setting. Implementation 
requires training and support for staff and adequate consideration of camper and 
family needs. 
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any employee rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public 
health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA 
has more safety and health guidance on its Cal/OSHA Guidance on Requirements to 
Protect Workers from Coronavirus webpage.

1.General Measures
•Establish and continue communication with local and State authorities to
determine current disease levels and control measures in your
community. For example:
oReview and refer to, if applicable, the relevant county variance
documentation. Documentation can be found here.
oConsult with your county health officer, or designated staff, who are
best positioned to monitor and provide advice on local conditions. A
directory can be found here.
oRegularly review updated guidance from state agencies, including
the California Department of Public Health.
•Ensure external community organizations that use the facilities also follow
this guidance.
•Develop a plan for the possibility of repeated closures when persons
associated with the facility or in the community become ill with COVID-
19.
•Establish a written, worksite-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every
facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and
work tasks, and designate a person at each school to implement the
plan.
▪Identify contact information for the local health department where
the school is located for communicating information about COVID-
19 outbreaks among students or staff.
▪Incorporate the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face Coverings, into
the Work Site Specific Plan that includes a policy for handling
exemptions.
▪Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on
the plan. Make the written plan available and accessible to workers
and worker representatives.
▪Regularly evaluate the workplace for compliance with the plan and
document and correct deficiencies identified.
▪Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan
as needed to prevent further cases.
3
----------------Page (2) Break----------------
▪Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a
workplace has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines.
▪Identify individuals who have been in close contact (within six feet for
15 minutes or more) of an infected person and take steps to isolate
COVID-19 positive person(s) and close contacts. See Section 10 for
more detail.
▪Adhere to these guidelines. Failure to do so could result in workplace
illnesses that may cause classrooms or the entire school to be
temporarily closed or limited.
•The more people a camper or staff member interacts with, and the 
longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. The risk of 
COVID-19 spread increases in youth camp settings as follows:
oLowest Risk: Small groups of campers stay together all day, each day. 
Campers remain at least 6 feet apart and do not share objects. 
Outdoor activities are prioritized. All campers are from the same local 
geographic area (e.g., town, city or county).
oHighest Risk: Campers mix between groups and do not remain 
spaced apart. All campers are not from the local geographic area 
(e.g., town, city or county).
•Promote Healthy Hygiene Practices
•Educate staff, campers and their families about when they should stay 
home and when they can return to camp. Actively encourage staff and 
campers who are sick or have recently had a close contact with a 
person with COVID-19 to stay home.
•Ensure adequate supplies to support healthy hygiene behaviors, including 
soap, tissues, no-touch trashcans and hand sanitizers with at least 60 
percent ethyl alcohol for staff and campers who can safely use hand 
sanitizer. Employers must provide and ensure staff use face coverings and 
all required protective equipment.
•Teach and reinforce washing hands, avoiding contact with one's eyes, 
nose, and mouth, and covering coughs and sneezes among campers
and staff. 
oTeach campers to use tissue to wipe their nose and to cough/sneeze
inside a tissue or their elbow.
oCampers and staff should wash their hands frequently throughout the
day, including before and after eating; after coughing or sneezing;
4
----------------Page (3) Break----------------
after classes where they handle shared items, such as outside 
recreation, art, or shop; and before and after using the restroom. 
oCampers and staff should wash their hands for 20 seconds with soap,
rubbing thoroughly after application.
oStaff should model and practice handwashing. For example, for
younger campers, use bathroom time as an opportunity to reinforce
healthy habits and monitor proper handwashing.
oCampers and staff should use fragrance-free hand sanitizer when
handwashing is not practicable. Sanitizer must be rubbed into hands
until completely dry. Note: frequent handwashing is more effective
than the use of hand sanitizers.
oChildren under age 9 should use hand sanitizer under adult
supervision. Call Poison Control if consumed: 1-800-222-1222.
oEthyl alcohol-based hand sanitizers are preferred and should be used
when there is the potential of unsupervised use by children.
▪Isopropyl hand sanitizers are more toxic when ingested or
absorbed in skin.
▪Do not use hand sanitizers that may contain methanol which
can be hazardous when ingested or absorbed.
•Consider portable handwashing stations throughout a site to minimize
movement and congregations in bathrooms to the extent practicable.
•Consider routines enabling camp staff and campers to regularly wash
their hands at staggered intervals.
•Teach and reinforce use of face coverings.
•Face coverings must be used in accordance with CDPH guidelines unless
a person is exempt as explained in the guidelines. Physical distancing
alone is not sufficient to prevent disease transmission.
oAll camp staff must use face coverings unless Cal/OSHA standards
require respiratory protection. In limited situations (i.e. communicating
or assisting young children or those with special needs) a face shield
can be used instead of a face covering as long as the wearer
maintains physical distance from others, to the extent practicable.
Staff must return to wearing a face covering when the face shield is
not necessary.
oChildren aged 2 years and older should wear face coverings in
accordance with in accordance with CDPH guidelines, especially
5
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
when indoors or outdoors when a six-foot physical distance from 
others cannot be maintained.  
oFace coverings should not be placed on children younger than 2
years old. A face covering should not be used by anyone who has
trouble breathing, anyone who is unconscious or incapacitated, or
anyone who is otherwise unable to remove the face covering without
assistance.
oA face covering should be removed for meals, snacks, naptime, or
outdoor recreation, or when it needs to be replaced. When a cloth
face covering is temporarily removed, it should be placed in a clean
paper bag (marked with the student’s name and date) until it needs
to be put on again.
oCamp staff and campers should be frequently reminded not to touch
the face covering and to wash their hands frequently.
oInformation should be provided to all camp staff and campers on
proper use, removal and washing of face coverings.
3. Intensify Cleaning, Disinfection, and
Ventilation
•Consider suspending or modifying use of site resources necessitating
sharing or touching items. For example, consider suspending use of
drinking fountains and instead encourage the use of reusable water
bottles.
•Staff should clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at camp
and on all transportation vehicles, such as buses or vans, at least daily,
and, as practicable, frequently throughout the day by trained custodial
staff.
•Frequently touched surfaces in the camp include, but are not limited to:
oDoor handles
oLight switches
oSink handles
oBathroom surfaces
oTables
•Limit use of shared playground equipment in favor of physical activities
that require less contact with surfaces.
6
----------------Page (5) Break----------------
•Limit sharing of objects and equipment, such as toys, games and art
supplies, to the extent practicable. When sharing is allowed, clean and
disinfect between uses.
•When choosing disinfecting products, use those approved for use against
COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved list
“N” and follow product instructions.
oTo reduce the risk of asthma and other health effects
related to disinfecting, programs should select disinfectant
products on list N with asthma-safer ingredients (hydrogen
peroxide, citric acid or lactic acid) as recommended by
the US EPA Design for Environment program.
oAvoid products that contain peroxyacetic
(paracetic) acid, sodium hypochlorite (bleach) or
quaternary ammonium compounds, which can
cause asthma.
oFollow label directions for appropriate dilution rates and
contact times. Provide employees training on the chemical
hazards, proper ventilation, manufacturer’s directions, and
on Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use, and as required by
the Healthy Schools Act, as applicable.
oCustodial staff and other employees who clean and
disinfect the facility site must be equipped with proper
protective equipment, including gloves, eye protection,
respiratory protection, and other appropriate protective
equipment as required by the product instructions. All
products must be kept out of children’s reach and stored
in a space with restricted access.
oEstablish a cleaning and disinfecting schedule in order to
avoid both under- and over-use of cleaning products.
•Ensure safe and correct application of disinfectant and keep products
away from campers.
•Ensure proper ventilation during cleaning and disinfecting. Introduce
fresh outdoor air as much as possible, for example, by opening windows
where practicable. When cleaning, air out the space before children
arrive; plan to do thorough cleaning when children are not present. If
using air conditioning, use the setting that brings in outside air. Replace
and check air filters and filtration systems to ensure optimal air quality.
oIf opening windows poses a safety or health risk (e.g., by allowing
pollen in or exacerbating asthma symptoms) to persons using the
7
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
facility, consider alternatives. For example, maximize central air 
filtration for HVAC systems (targeted filter rating of at least MERV 13). 
oConsider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in
classrooms, offices and other spaces.
•Take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (for example,
drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a
prolonged facility shutdown to minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease
and other diseases associated with water.
•Provide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on
walls, to ensure that camp staff and campers remain at least 6 feet apart
in lines and at other times (e.g., guides for creating “one-way routes” in
hallways).
•Follow CDC’s considerations for Pools, Hot Tubs, and Water Playgrounds
During COVID-19.
4. Implementing Distancing
ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE 
•Limit the number of persons in the camp to the number appropriate for
maintaining physical distancing.
•If transport vehicles (e.g., buses) are used by the camp, drivers should
practice all safety actions and protocols as indicated for other staff (e.g.,
hand hygiene, face coverings, and physical distancing).
•Minimize contact between camp staff, campers and families at the
beginning and end of the day.
•Stagger arrival and drop off-times and locations as consistently as
practicable as to minimize scheduling challenges for families.
•Designate routes for entry and exit, using as many entrances as feasible.
Put in place other protocols to limit direct contact with others as much as
practicable.
•Open windows and maximize space between campers and the driver on
transport vehicles where possible.
•Consider using privacy boards or clear screens.
•Ensure transport vehicles are equipped with extra unused face coverings
for students who may have inadvertently failed to bring one.
8
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
RECREATIONAL SPACE 
•Campers should remain in the same space and in groups as small and
consistent as practicable. Keep the same campers and staff with each
group and include campers from the same family in the same group, to
the greatest extent practicable.
•Maximize space (minimum 6-foot separation) between seating, desks,
and bedding. Consider ways to establish separation of campers through
other means, for example, six feet between seats, partitions between
seats, markings on floors to promote distancing, arranging seating in a
way that minimizes face-to-face contact.
•Consider redesigning activities for smaller groups and rearranging
furniture and play spaces to maintain separation.
•Staff should develop instructions for maximizing spacing and ways to
minimize movement in both indoor and outdoor spaces that are easy for
children to understand and are developmentally appropriate.
•Restrict nonessential visitors, volunteers, and activities involving other
groups at the same time.
•Restrict communal activities where practicable. If this is not practicable,
stagger use, properly space occupants, keep groups as small and
consistent and disinfect in between uses.
•Limit gatherings, events and extracurricular activities to those that can
maintain physical distancing and support proper hand hygiene.
•Use alternative spaces as needed, including regular use of outdoor
space, weather permitting. For example, consider ways to maximize
outside space, and the use of cafeterias and other spaces for use to
permit physical distancing.
•Minimize congregate movement as much as practicable.
MEALS 
•Have campers bring their own meals as feasible, and practice physical
distancing when eating or within their smaller group, instead of in a
communal dining hall or cafeteria. Ensure the safety of children with food
allergies.
•Use disposable food service items (e.g., utensils and plates). If disposable
items are not feasible, ensure that all non-disposable food service items
are handled with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water or in a
dishwasher. Individuals should wash their hands after removing their
gloves or after directly handling used food service items.
9
----------------Page (8) Break----------------
•If food is offered at any event, have pre-packaged boxes or bags for
each attendee instead of a buffet or family-style meal. Avoid sharing of
foods and utensils and ensure the safety of children with food allergies.
•Plan for physical distancing during employee lunch and breaks by
staggering times, providing additional break space, or other ways for staff
to physical distance. Hold meetings virtually, particularly where physical
distancing is a challenge, if possible.
5. Limit Sharing
•Keep each camper’s belongings separated and in individually labeled
storage containers, cubbies or areas. Ensure belongings are taken home
each day to be cleaned and disinfected.
•Ensure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high-touch materials (art
supplies, equipment, etc.) to the extent practicable or limit use of supplies
and equipment to one group of children at a time and clean and
disinfect between uses.
•Avoid sharing electronic devices, clothing, toys, books and other games
or learning aids as much as practicable. Where sharing occurs, clean
and disinfect between uses.
6. Train All Staff and Families
•Train all camp staff and families in the following safety actions:
oEnhanced sanitation practices
oPhysical distancing guidelines and their importance
oProper use, removal and washing of cloth face coverings.
oScreening practices
oCOVID-19 specific exclusion criteria
•Consider conducting the training virtually, or, if in-person, ensure
distancing is maintained.
•Designate a staff person (e.g., camp nurse or healthcare provider) to be
responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. All camp staff and
families should know who this person is and how to contact them.
10
----------------Page (9) Break----------------
7.Check for Signs and Symptoms
•Train staff, and educate campers and their families about when they
should stay home and when they can return to camp. Actively
encourage staff and campers who are sick or who have recently
had close contact with a person with COVID-19 to stay home.
•Implement screening procedures for all staff and campers before they
enter the facility.
oConduct visual wellness checks of all campers upon arrival and take
campers’ temperatures at the beginning of each day with a no-
touch thermometer. If a thermometer requiring a touch-method
(under the tongue or arm, forehead, etc.) is the only type available, it
should only be used when a fever is strongly suspected. Only the
person being screened or someone from their household should use a
thermometer requiring a touch-method. Thermometers must be
properly cleaned and disinfected after each use, and protective
sleeves should be used.
oAsk all individuals about COVID-19 symptoms within the last 24 hours
and whether anyone in their home has had COVID-19 symptoms or a
positive test.
oMake available and encourage use of handwashing stations or hand
sanitizer.
oDocument/track incidents of possible exposure and notify local
health officials, staff and families immediately of any positive case of
COVID-19 while maintaining confidentiality.
oExclude any child, parent, caregiver or staff showing symptoms of
COVID-19. Staff should discuss with parent/caregiver and refer to the
child’s health history form and/or emergency card to identify if the
child has a history of allergies, which would not be a reason to
exclude.
•Monitor staff and campers throughout the day for signs of illness; send
home campers and staff with a fever of 100.4 degrees or higher, cough
or other COVID-19 symptoms. Send persons to the appropriate medical
facility rather than their home when necessary.
11
----------------Page (10) Break----------------
8. Plan for When a Staff Member, Child or
Visitor Becomes Sick
•Work with camp staff, nurses and other healthcare providers to identify
an isolation room or area to separate anyone who exhibits symptoms of
COVID-19.
•Any campers or staff exhibiting symptoms should immediately be
required to wear a face covering and be required to wait in an isolation
area until they can be transported home or to a healthcare facility, as
soon as practicable.
•Establish procedures for safely transporting anyone sick to home or a
healthcare facility, as appropriate, when an individual is exhibiting
COVID-19 symptoms:
oFever
oCough
oShortness of breath or difficulty breathing
oChills
oRepeated shaking with chills
oFatigue
oMuscle pain
oHeadache
oSore throat
oCongestion or runny nose
oNausea or vomiting
oDiarrhea
oNew loss of taste or smell
•For serious injury or illness, call 9-1-1 without delay. Seek medical attention
if COVID-19 symptoms become severe, including persistent pain or
pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. Updates and further
details are available on CDC’s webpage.
12
----------------Page (11) Break----------------
•Notify local health officials, staff, and all families immediately of any
positive case of COVID-19 while maintaining confidentiality as required
by state and federal laws.
•Close off areas used by any sick person and do not use before cleaning
and disinfection. To reduce risk of exposure, wait 24 hours before you
clean and disinfect. If it is not possible to wait 24 hours, wait as long as
practicable. Ensure a safe and correct application of disinfectants using
personal protective equipment and ventilation recommended for
cleaning. Keep cleaning and disinfectant products away from children.
•Advise sick staff members and campers not to return until they have met
CDC criteria to discontinue home isolation, including 3 days with no fever,
symptoms have improved and 10 days since symptoms first appeared.
•For areas with a large geographic distribution, consider restricting
attendance to campers who live in the local geographic area and ask
campers to avoid movement between camps when they are from a high
transmission area.
•Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines.
•Investigate the COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related factors
could have contributed to risk of infection. Update protocols as needed
to prevent further cases.
•Update protocols as needed to prevent further cases. See the CDPH
guidelines, Responding to COVID-19 in the Workplace, which are
incorporated into this guidance and contain detailed recommendations
for establishing a plan to identify cases, communicate with employees
and other exposed persons, and conducting and assisting with contact
tracing.
9. Maintain Healthy Operations
•Monitor staff absenteeism and have a roster of trained back-up staff
where available.
•Monitor the types of illnesses and symptoms among your camp staff and
campers to help isolate them promptly.
•Designate a staff liaison or liaisons to be responsible for responding to
COVID-19 concerns. Employees should know about who they are and
how to contact them. The liaison should be trained to coordinate the
documentation and tracking of possible exposure, in order to notify local
health officials, staff and families in a prompt and responsible manner.
13
----------------Page (12) Break----------------
14 
•Maintain communication systems that allow staff and families to self-
report symptoms and receive prompt notifications of exposures and
closures, while maintaining confidentiality.
10. Considerations for Partial or Total Closures
•Check State and local orders and health department notices daily about
transmission in the area or closures and adjust operations accordingly.
•When a camper or staff member tests positive for COVID-19 and has
exposed others at the camp, implement the following steps:
oIn consultation with the local public health department, the
appropriate camp official may consider if closure is warranted and
length of time based on the risk level within the specific community as
determined by the local public health officer.
oGiven standard guidance for isolation at home for at least 14 days
after close contact, the facility or office where the patient was based
will typically need to close temporarily as campers or staff isolate.
oAdditional close contacts at camp should also isolate at home.
oAdditional areas of the camp facility visited by the COVID-19 positive
individual may also need to be closed temporarily for cleaning and
disinfection.
oImplement communication plans for camp closure to include
outreach to campers, parents, staff and the community.
oMaintain regular communications with the local public health
department.
