OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at 
home to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that 
may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with 
serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at 
higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when 
people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, 
even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available 
at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating 
that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of 
these workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food 
production, warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not
required) and customers/clients,
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention
plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for the manufacturing industry to support a safe, 
clean environment for workers. The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any 
worker rights, either statutory, regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not 
exhaustive, as it does not include county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any 
existing safety and health-related regulatory requirements such as those of 
Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public health guidance and state/local 
orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has additional safety and 
health guidance on their Cal/OSHA General Guidelines on Protecting Workers from 
COVID-19 webpage. CDC has additional information on their guidance for 
businesses and employers.

Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or
distribution to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance;
•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When
no passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering 
requirements in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful 
workplace. Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers 
for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one 
of the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot 
wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if 
feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude 
any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying 
with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these 
exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Worksite Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, worksite-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every 
facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and 
work tasks,and designate a person at each facility to implement the 
plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance CDPH Face Covering 
Guidance. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
facility is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on 
the plan and make the plan available to workers and their 
representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the workplace for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as 
needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace 
has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) 
and close contacts. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in 
workplace illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily 
closed or limited. 
Topics for Worker Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to 
contracting the virus. 
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom 
checks using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work:

o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, 
such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty 
breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of 
taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea, OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR 
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone 
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered 
potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 
10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms 
have improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of 
fever reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without 
symptoms who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only if 
10 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 test. 
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, 
including scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer 
with at least 60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product 
is inaccessible to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a 
sink or handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time 
(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do 
not replace the need for physical distancing and frequent 
handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or 
discarded after each shift.

• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face 
coverings must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, 
work rules, and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use 
of face coverings. Training should also include the employer’s policies 
on how people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will 
be handled. 
• Ensure any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers 
at the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies 
and have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities 
ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract 
workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to 
receive that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See 
additional information on government programs supporting sick leave 
and worker’s compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick 
leave rights under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and 
workers’ rights to workers’ compensation benefits and presumption of 
the work-relatedness of COVID-19 pursuant to the Governor’s Executive 
Order N-62-20 while that Order is in effect. 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers 
entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom 
screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible. 
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative 
to providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was 
performed prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and 
follows CDC guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training 
section above. 
• Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to 
stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful 
to supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; 
examples are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or 
handling commonly touched items.

• Non-employees entering the facility should be restricted to only those 
classified as essential by management and they must complete a 
temperature and/or symptom screening before entering. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Perform thorough cleaning on high traffic areas such as break rooms, 
lunch areas, and changing areas, and areas of ingress and egress 
including, stairways and stairwells, handrails, and elevators controls. 
Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces, including, doorknobs, 
toilets, and handwashing facilities. 
• Clean touchable surfaces between shifts or between users, whichever 
is more frequent, including but not limited to working surfaces, tools, 
handles and latches, and controls on stationary and mobile 
equipment, including surfaces in the cabs of all vehicles. 
• Avoid sharing phones, office supplies, other work tools, or handheld 
mobile communications equipment wherever possible. Individually-
assigned peripheral equipment (keyboards, handsets, headsets, chairs, 
etc.) should be provided wherever possible. If necessary, clean and 
disinfect them before and after each use. Never share PPE. 
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their 
shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as 
part of the worker’s job duties. 
• Ensure sanitary facilities restrooms and handwashing stations with soap 
and hand sanitizer are provided at all sites. Ensure that sanitary facilities 
stay operational and stocked at all times and provide additional soap, 
paper towels, and hand sanitizer when needed. 
• Stagger breaks and provide additional sanitary facilities (including 
portable toilets and handwashing stations) if feasible and necessary to 
maintain physical distancing during scheduled breaks. No-touch sinks, 
soap dispensers, sanitizer dispensers, and paper towel dispensersshould 
be installed whenever possible. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use product 
approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. Use 
disinfectant labels labeled to be effective against emerging viral 
pathogens, diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per 
gallon of water), or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are 
appropriate for the surface. Provide workers training on the chemical 
hazards, manufacturer’s directions, ventilation requirements, and 
Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or

disinfectants should wear gloves as required by the product 
instructions. Follow the asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended 
by the California Department of Public Health and ensure proper 
ventilation. 
• Workers must be provided and use protective equipment when 
offloading and storing delivered goods. Workers should inspect 
deliveries and perform disinfection measures prior to storing goods in 
warehouses and facilities, when deliveries appear tampered with. 
• Require that hard hats and face shields be sanitized at the end of each 
shift. Clean the inside of the face shield, then the outside, then wash 
hands. 
• Clean delivery vehicles and equipment before and after delivery 
routes, carry additional sanitation materials during deliveries, and use 
clean personal protective equipment for each delivery stop. 
• For delivery drivers, normally accessible restrooms on routes (e.g., 
restaurants, coffee shops) may be closed. Employers should provide 
workers alternative restroom locations and allow time for workers to use 
them. 
• Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that 
can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter 
wherever possible. 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the 
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other 
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in 
work and break areas. 
• Modify offerings in on-site cafeterias, including using prepackaged 
foods, and safe options for drink, condiment, and flatware dispensing. 
Businesses with these operations should follow additional applicable 
guidance for restaurants available on the COVID-19 Resilience 
Roadmap website. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between workers. This can include use of physical partitions or visual 
cues (e.g., floor markings, or signs to indicate to where workers should 
stand). 
• Adjust safety or other in-person meetings, including interviews, to 
ensure physical distance and use smaller individual meetings at 
facilities to maintain physical distancing guidelines.

• Utilize work practices, when feasible, to limit the number of workers on 
site at one time. This may include scheduling (e.g., staggering shift 
start/end times) or rotating access to a designated area during a shift. 
Stage facilities to stagger work and limit overlap of work crews. 
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options 
that minimize their contact with customers and other workers 
(e.g., managing inventory or managing administrative needs 
through telework). 
• Stagger worker breaks, within compliance with wage and hour 
regulations, to maintain physical distancing protocols. Reassign lockers 
or limit/stagger locker use to increase distance between workers. 
• Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed 
areas, to ensure at least six feet of separation to limit transmission of 
the virus. 
• Close breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance between 
tables/chairs to separate workers and discourage congregating 
during breaks. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with 
shade covers and seating that ensures physical distancing. 
• Workers should consider bringing a lunch made at home or 
purchase take out or delivery where available as long as they can 
avoid congested areas. 
• Use the following hierarchy to prevent transmission of COVID-19 in 
work areas especially where physical distancing is difficult to 
maintain: engineering controls, administrative controls, and PPE. 
o Engineering controls include creating physical or spatial 
barriers between workers such as Plexiglas or other sturdy 
and impermeable partitions. 
o Administrative controls include increasing the number of shifts 
to reduce the number of personnel present at one time and 
ensure adequate physical distancing. 
o PPE includes face shields, some types of masks, and impermeable 
gloves. Note that some disposable equipment such as respirators 
are prioritized for health care workers and workers that handle 
pathogens and should not otherwise be used. 
• Install production transfer-aiding materials, such as shelving and 
bulletin boards, to reduce person-to-person production hand-offs. 
• Designate separate entrance and exits and post signage to this effect.

industry must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance 
as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the 
California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers must be prepared to 
alter their operations as those guidelines change.
