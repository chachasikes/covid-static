COVID-19 
INDUSTRY 
GUIDANCE: 
Amusement Parks  
and Theme Parks 
October 20, 2020 
This guidance is designed to address 
sectors and activities opening statewide. 
However, local health officers may 
implement more stringent rules tailored 
to local epidemiological conditions, so 
employers should also confirm relevant 
local opening policies.

OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that 
person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, restaurants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
 physical distancing to the maximum extent possible, 
 use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not 
required) and guests, 
 frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, 
 training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention 
plan. 
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus.

PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for amusement parks and theme parks (referred to 
as “amusement parks”) to support a safe, clean environment for workers and 
customers. Businesses must identify and monitor the County Risk Level for the county 
the business is operating in and make required adjustments to their operations: 
•Purple – Widespread – Tier 1: All operations must be closed.
•Red – Substantial – Tier 2: All operations must be closed.
•Orange – Moderate – Tier 3: Operations are permitted only for smaller parks (see
definition below) and those operators must implement the following
modifications:
oSmaller parks are defined as parks with overall capacity fewer than 15,000
based on the design/operating capacity or fire department occupant
limit.
oCapacity must be limited to 25% of total facility occupancy based on the
design/operating capacity or fire department occupant limit - whichever is
fewer - or 500 people, whichever is fewer.
oOnly outdoor attractions are permitted to open; all other indoor attractions
must remain closed.
oTicket sales must be limited only to those visitors who reside in the same
county as the park’s location.
oOperators must follow the modifications in this guidance and must be
prepared for inspections by public health officials to ensure adequate
implementation of all required modifications. Operators must address and
implement any resulting findings and recommendations
•Yellow – Minimal – Tier 4: Operations are permitted for all amusement park
operators with the following modifications:
oCapacity must be limited to 25% of total facility occupancy based on the
design/operating capacity or fire department occupant limit, whichever is
fewer.
oCapacity on all indoor dining and drinking establishments within the park
must be limited to 25%.
oOperators must follow the modifications in this guidance and must be
prepared for inspections by public health officials to ensure adequate
implementation of all required modifications. Operators must address and
implement any resulting findings and recommendations.
For the most updated information on county tier status, visit Blueprint for a Safer 
Economy. Please note that local health departments can have more restrictive criteria 
and different closures. Find your county’s local information.  
NOTE: Amusement parks have a number of operational aspects and service offerings 
3
----------------Page (2) Break----------------
available in other guidance on the Industry Guidance to Reduce Risk website. 
Operators must review this guidance to apply the appropriate protocols to all aspects 
of their operations. Such operations may include: 
• Food service and concessions (Restaurant guidance) 
• Bars (Bars, Breweries, and Distilleries guidance) 
• Gift shops and retail operations (Retail guidance) 
• Hotels and lodging (Hotels, Lodging, and Short-Term Rentals guidance) 
• Family entertainment centers, including miniature golf and arcades (Family 
Entertainment Centers guidance) 
• Interactive exhibits (Zoos and Museums guidance)  
• Trams, shuttles, and other transit (Public and Private Passenger Carriers, Transit, 
and Intercity Passenger Rail guidance) 
o Limit shuttle service whenever possible and in accordance with obligations 
to individuals with disabilities. 
• Grounds, building maintenance, custodial services (Limited Services guidance) 
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public 
health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA 
has more safety and health guidance on their Cal/OSHA Guidance on Requirements to 
Protect Workers from Coronavirus webpage. CDC has additional for businesses and 
employers.  
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. Complete details, 
including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be found in the 
guidance.  
 
The CDPH Face Covering Guidance is subject to additional updates based on the 
current scientific understanding of transmission of the virus causing COVID-19. Please 
check the CDPH website for any revisions.

----------------Page (3) Break----------------
  
 Workplace Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every 
facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and 
work tasks, and designate a person at each facility to implement the 
plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
facility is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers or patrons. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the workplace for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as 
needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has 
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines and orders or 
guidance from the local health department. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) and 
close contacts. 
• Notify all employees in writing, and employers of subcontracted 
employees, who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and report 
workplace outbreaks to the local health department. For additional 
information on employer responsibilities under AB 685 (Chapter 84, 
Statutes of 2020), refer to the Enhanced Enforcement and Employer 
Reporting Requirements from Cal/OSHA and the Employer Questions 
about AB 685 from CDPH. 
• For outdoor operations: Establish an effective heat illness prevention plan 
with written procedures in both English and the language understood by 
the majority of the employees. The plan must be available to employees 
at the worksite. See the Cal/OSHA heat illness prevention page for 
resources, including FAQs, a webinar, and a sample written plan. 
Elements of a heat illness prevent plan must include: 
o Access to potable drinking water 
5
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
oAccess to shade
oCool down breaks
oEmergency procedures for heat illness cases
oHigh heat procedures when the temperature exceeds 95 degrees
oMonitoring of employees who are acclimatizing during a heat wave
oTraining on heat illness prevention and symptoms
•Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited.
Topics for Worker Training 
•Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which
people are at higher risk for severe illness or death.
•Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks
using CDC guidelines.
•The importance of not coming to work:
oIf a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, such
as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,
fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell,
sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea,
OR
oIf a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been
released from isolation, OR
oIf, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered
potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation).
•To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only after
meeting CDPH Guidance on Returning to Work or School Following
COVID-19 Diagnosis.
•To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face.
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage.
•The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible
to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). Never use hand sanitizers with
6
----------------Page (5) Break----------------
methanol due to its high toxicity to both children and adults. 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time 
(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings do not replace the need for physical distancing and 
frequent handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or 
discarded after each shift. 
• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and 
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. 
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who 
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled. 
• Heat illness symptoms and prevention following Cal/OSHA requirements. 
• Ensure independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at the 
facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and 
have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of 
time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive 
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional 
information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers’ 
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under 
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. 
 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Use of face coverings is mandatory throughout the park in all settings 
indoor and outdoor, unless actively eating or drinking in designated 
dining areas or exempted per the CDPH Face Covering Guidance. 
Customers who do not comply should be removed from the facility 
immediately.  
7
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors or contractors entering the park. 
Make sure the temperature/symptom screener avoids close contact with 
workers to the extent possible.  
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to 
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed 
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC 
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. 
• Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to 
stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to 
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are 
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly 
touched items. Workers must be provided and wear gloves when 
receiving items handled by others (e.g. cash or coins) or handling items 
contaminated by body fluids.   
• Workers who consistently must be within six feet of guests or co-workers 
(e.g., fitting and securing guests with safety equipment) must wear a 
secondary barrier (e.g. face shield or safety goggles) in addition to a 
face covering. All workers should minimize the amount of time spent 
within six feet of guests. 
• Implement a reservation system for the park. Utilize the reservation system 
to contact guests (e.g. by email, call, or text) with reservations 24 hours 
before their scheduled arrival to confirm their reservation and ask if they 
or someone in their household is exhibiting any COVID-19 symptoms. If the 
guest answers in the affirmative the guest should be instructed that they 
should not come to the amusement park because they will not be 
permitted entry.  
• If possible, implement a reservation system or virtual queuing system for 
individual attractions to ensure capacity limits and physical distancing 
can be maintained.  
• Develop a policy that requires guests to wear face coverings or be 
denied access to the amusement or theme park. Permit access for guests 
who are exempt from wearing face coverings as stated in the CDPH 
Face Covering Guidance. As part of the policy, remind guests in 
advance to bring a face covering and make them available to anyone 
who arrives without one.  
• Guests should be temperature and/or symptom screened upon arrival, 
asked to use hand sanitizer, and must bring and wear a face covering 
8
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
when not eating or drinking if not exempted per the CDPH Face 
Covering Guidance. Amusement park operators must cancel 
reservations for individuals/parties with symptomatic guests and refuse 
entry. 
•Display a set of clearly visible rules and reminders, including posting
signage at entrances and in other strategic and highly-visible locations
and in ticket purchase confirmations, for guests and personnel that are to
be a condition of entry and must be adhered to during the entirety of the
guest’s visit to the amusement park. The rules should include instructions
to wear face coverings at all times, except when eating or drinking in
designated dining areas; use hand sanitizer; maintain physical distance
from other guests and workers; and avoid unnecessary touching of
surfaces. Whenever possible, the rules should be available digitally, e.g.
through apps, texts, or email.
•Designate a sufficient number of staff to enforce adherence to the face
coverings requirement throughout the park to ensure physical distancing
is maintained in all areas, with a particular focus on queues and other
areas of potential congregation. Guests who do not comply should be
removed from the facility immediately. Allow for exemptions identified in
the CDPH Face Covering Guidance.
Ventilation, Cleaning, and Disinfecting 
Protocols 
•Implement ways to minimize time indoors and minimize the number of
household groups indoors and stationary at the same time.
•Where possible, install portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrade
indoor area’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and make other
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in
offices and other indoor spaces.
•Check the CDPH website periodically for updates on indoor air quality
and ventilation guidance for airborne diseases in indoor settings.
•Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas such as park entrances
and exits, restroom facilities and baby changing stations, dining areas,
gift stores, shuttle/tram stations or stops, worker break rooms, etc., and
areas of ingress and egress, including stairways, handrails, and elevator
banks. Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces, including
countertops, touchscreens, buttons, doorknobs, armrests, toilets, coin-
operated and redemption games, vending machines, etc.
•Thoroughly clean and disinfect each guest activity area after every use.
This should include cleaning and disinfecting tables, chairs, benches,
9
----------------Page (8) Break----------------
booths, booster seats, high chairs, etc. Allow adequate time for proper 
disinfection, following product instructions.  
•Adjust or modify operating hours, as needed, to provide adequate time
for regular thorough cleaning and disinfection.
•Where possible, avoid cash transactions and utilize credit card readers
that enable guests to insert/swipe their own cards, so workers do not
have to do it for them. If the credit card machines break physical
distance, workers should step back while the guest makes payment.
Where feasible and appropriate, work with payment partners to increase
the dollar limits for purchases that do not require a Personal Identification
Number (PIN) or a signature.
•Assign one worker to each Point-of-Sale (POS) terminal, if possible. Clean
and disinfect terminals between each user and after each shift. If
multiple workers are assigned to one POS terminal, workers should wash
their hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer before and after
each use.
•Clean and disinfect strollers, electric conveyance vehicles, and
wheelchairs between every rental. Consider providing additional
disinfecting wipes to the guests so they can also wipe down units once
they rent them.
•Provide disposable or single-use maps, pamphlets, guides, etc. to guests
and make these available digitally so that guests can view on a personal
electronic device, if possible. If single-use items cannot be provided,
properly disinfect reusable ones before and after guest use.
•Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times
and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when
needed. Provide resources to promote personal hygiene. This will include
tissues, no-touch trash cans, hand soap, adequate time for
handwashing, alcohol-based hand sanitizers, disinfectant wipes, and
disposable towels
•Provide additional handwashing or hand sanitizer hygiene stations
throughout the amusement park, including help counters, information
desks, attractions, rides, ticket booth windows, dining areas, gift shops,
and entry points.
•Make hand sanitizer available for guests to use when activity items come
into contact with shared surfaces. Encourage guests to wash hands
and/or use hand sanitizer often while using equipment and items.
Remind members of the public (with signs and/or verbally) not to touch
their eyes, nose, and mouth.
•Regularly clean and disinfect surfaces shared by workers between shifts
or between users, whichever is more frequent, including but not limited
10
----------------Page (9) Break----------------
to working surfaces, time clocks, copy machines, keys, cleaning 
equipment, gaming machinery, etc. Avoid sharing equipment such as 
phones, tablets, office machinery, and tools wherever possible. Never 
share PPE. 
• Discontinue the shared use of audio headsets, tools, and other 
equipment between workers unless the equipment can be properly 
disinfected between each use. Consult equipment manufacturers to 
determine appropriate disinfection steps, particularly for soft, porous 
surfaces such as foam earmuffs. Consider providing disposable 
earphone covers where possible. 
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their 
shift. Assign cleaning assignments during working hours as part of the 
worker’s job duties.  
• Equip terminals, desks, and help counters with proper sanitation 
products, including hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes, and provide 
personal hand sanitizers to all staff directly assisting guests.  
• To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases 
associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and 
features (e.g., drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use 
after a prolonged facility shutdown.  
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, use products approved for use 
against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-
approved list and follow product instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to 
be effective against emerging viral pathogens, diluted household 
bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or alcohol solutions 
with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the surface. Provide 
workers training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer’s directions, 
ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. 
Workers using cleaners or disinfectants must wear gloves and other 
protective equipment as required by the product instructions. Follow the 
asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended by the California 
Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation. 
 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• WARNING: physical distancing alone is insufficient to prevent transmission 
of COVID-19.  
• Consider one-way foot traffic and clear directions to better control the 
flow of guests throughout the park, especially in certain heavily used 
and/or narrow throughways to allow for better guest separation.  Limit 
entry to crowded areas to allow for appropriate physical distancing. 
11
----------------Page (10) Break----------------
• Dedicate workers to direct guests at high traffic and bottleneck areas in 
indoor and outdoor facilities to avoid congregation. Consider using 
costumed cast members or other workers to create a dedicated team 
that can help regularly communicate new protocols to guests.  
• Install Plexiglass dividers on switchback lines/queues for attractions and 
concessions, or close sections of switchback lines/queues to ensure 
sufficient physical distance between visitors. 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between people, such as when guests are waiting in line, riding shuttles 
or trams in the park, or while seated for performances or shows. This can 
include use of physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings or 
signs to indicate to where workers and guests should stand). Ensure 
indoor capacity limits are posted and enforced for indoor retail and 
other indoor spaces. 
• Implement timed and/or advanced reservation ticketing systems and 
pre-assigned seating or activity areas, whenever possible, to stagger 
guest visits and help maintain physical distances.  
• Discontinue tours or guided experiences that combine households or 
individuals from different households into the same tour group. Tour 
guides must maintain at least six feet of physical distance from guests. 
Limit tours or guided experiences to household units.  
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with guests and other workers (e.g., managing 
inventory rather than working as a cashier or managing administrative 
needs through telework). 
• Reconfigure workspaces, if possible, to allow for at least six feet between 
workers and the public. Hold smaller meetings to maintain physical 
distancing guidelines and consider holding meetings outside or via online 
platforms or over the telephone. 
• Ensure workers can maintain physical distance in breakrooms, using 
barriers, increasing distance between tables/chairs to separate workers, 
etc. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade coverings 
and seating arrangements that ensures physical distancing. Discourage 
workers from congregating during breaks and ensure they are not eating 
or drinking without face coverings within six feet of each other. 
• Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas, 
such as supply rooms and counter areas, to ensure at least six feet of 
separation to limit transmission of the virus. 
• Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, 
to maintain physical distancing protocols.  
 
12
----------------Page (11) Break----------------
Additional Considerations for Admission, Entry, 
and Security 
•Ensure parking, entrance, and exit areas are marked, monitored, and
configured to allow for physical distancing and no crowding or
congregating.
•Use of face coverings is mandatory throughout the park in all settings
indoor and outdoor, unless actively eating and/or drinking. Guests who
do not comply should be removed from the facility immediately. Allow
for exemptions identified in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance.
•Consider ways to schedule staggered ingress in order to minimize lines for
wanding, bag check, and ticket scanning. Virtual queuing, for example,
could provide metered access to the front of a line.
•Protect ticketing offices and will call with impermeable barriers, like
Plexiglass. Instruct guests where to queue to maintain a minimum of six
feet of physical distance.
•Install Plexiglass dividers on any switchback lines/queues, including
queuing areas for entry, security, and admission, or close sections of
switchback lines/queues to ensure sufficient physical distance of at least
six feet between visitors.
•Encourage guests to make purchases online (prior to their visit) or from
apps once inside the park to minimize lines and on-site payment
transactions. Where possible, avoid paper tickets that require workers to
handle them for scanning. Consider whether guests could check
themselves in at self-service kiosks outside the health and security
screening area.
•Consider offering all-inclusive package deals/wristbands that combine
park admission, parking, food and beverage, and special upgrades like
reserved seating and cabana rental to reduce the number of
transactions made inside the park.
•Workers checking bags should modify activities to minimize directly
touching guest items. This could include using styluses or other instruments
to search bags, asking guests to open bags and move contents, etc.
Where practices might cause direct contact with patrons or their items,
workers should immediately sanitize hands or wear disposable gloves
and change between each guest search.
•In order to avoid touching guests’ personal items, park operators should
consider enforcing a small clear bag policy and ask guests to open their
own bags for inspection. Consider necessary exceptions for medical and
personal hygiene products.
13
----------------Page (12) Break----------------
• Implement security tools that allow workers to maintain at least six feet of 
physical distance from patrons. This could include the use of walk 
through metal detectors rather than hand wand metal detectors.  
• Walk-through metal detectors are effective at detecting metallic objects 
while allowing security workers to maintain social distance. Hand wands 
are a less costly alternative which still allow no-contact metal detection, 
but they require the security worker to be closer than six feet from the 
guest. Any worker conducting a pat-down search must wear disposable 
gloves that are immediately discarded after interaction with a guest, 
followed by handwashing or hand sanitizer before putting on a fresh pair 
of gloves. 
• Install and use touchless ticket scanners whenever possible. Ask guests to 
scan tickets themselves rather than passing digital electronic devices or 
paper tickets back and forth between workers and patrons. When 
workers must assist patrons and touching is necessary, workers must wear 
a face covering and wash hands and/or use hand sanitizer as described 
in this guidance. Guests must wear face coverings during the exchange 
and be encouraged to wash hands and/or use hand sanitizer after 
exchanging goods as well.  
• Evaluate locker arrangements where guests store personal belongings to 
ensure those spaces can be regularly cleaned and disinfected and 
appropriately spaced to allow for physical distancing. Consider closing 
or rotating some sections to allow for appropriate physical distancing 
during busy times. Post signs reminding guests to maintain physical 
distances of at least six feet and to wait for others to vacate before 
approaching the locker. Consider positioning a worker in the locker area 
to limit the number of people in the space at one time. Clean and 
disinfect lockers between each use or provide bags so guests can stow 
their personal items in those bags before placing them in a locker.  
• In the event of an emergency, amusement park operators should 
consider and plan for physical distancing in areas of ingress/egress and 
guest staging areas. 
 
Additional Considerations for All Rides and 
Attractions 
• Face coverings are mandatory when engaged with attractions and rides 
throughout the park. Allow for exemptions identified in the CDPH Face 
Covering Guidance. 
• Install Plexiglass dividers on switchback lines/queues, including queuing 
areas for rides and attractions, or close sections of switchback 
lines/queues to ensure sufficient physical distance between visitors. 
14
----------------Page (13) Break----------------
•All queuing must be performed in outdoor settings only. No indoor
queuing is allowed for any attraction or ride. For indoor attractions and
rides, develop an outdoor queuing system prior to entry into the
attraction’s indoor operation. Install impermeable barriers between lines
with switchback queuing areas or close sections of switchback
lines/queues to ensure sufficient physical distance between visitors.
•Consider alternative queuing methods where possible to manage
capacity and facilitate physical distancing. Guests must wear face
coverings and be at least six feet apart during queuing. Consider using a
virtual queue system where practical (e.g. guests could make online
reservations for particular attractions through an app or during the ticket
purchasing process). Provide staffing to monitor guest compliance with
distancing and face coverings while in queues.
•Evaluate the speed and other dynamics of each attraction to ensure
face coverings of various types (e.g. common surgical masks with loops
around ears, face coverings with a strap that goes around the back of
the head, bandaging or other fabric tied around head) can be safely
worn and secured on rides. Face coverings must not present a loose-
article hazard or interfere with the safe operation of the attraction when
used by either riders or ride operators. If necessary, consult with the ride
manufacturer/supplier to decide which types of face coverings are
appropriate for specific rides.
•Discontinue use of a ride or attraction where use of face coverings
presents a safety issue or high incidence of loss of face covering during
operation.
•Face coverings must be made available to visitors who lose their face
coverings during a ride or attraction.
•Cleaning and disinfecting protocols are important for high-touch
surfaces on rides and attractions. Regularly clean and disinfect all
surfaces frequently touched by guests or workers, including handrails,
arm rests, restraints, lap bars, grips, seatbelts, over-the-shoulder harnesses,
etc. Develop the frequency and approach to the cleaning and
disinfecting process in accordance with the cleaning product
instructions and the ride manufacturer’s directions and based on the
type of surface being cleaned. Make sure virus kill times and drying times
are considered prior to opening the attraction or loading guests for the
next cycle. Make sure the ride is secured and follow appropriate
hazardous energy control procedures (including safety “lock out, tag
out” as needed) so workers can safely access the areas they need to
clean.
•Frequently clean and disinfect all control and dispatch panels,
buttons/switches, or other operator contact surfaces used to control the
15

ride at a minimum between each worker rotation, and provide workers 
operating the rides with hand sanitizer and time for handwashing.   
•Follow manufacturer guidelines/standard operating protocols to ensure
restraints are locked, seatbelts are fastened, and riders are properly
secured.
•If workers must use their hands to ensure a gate is locked and ride is
secured, those workers must wash or sanitize their hands before moving
on to another task.
•Conduct height checks according to existing protocols to ensure they
are accurate. Consider refining height check operations to make them
touch-free and easy to manage and view from a few feet away (e.g.
highly visible height markers, elevated bar for the guest to stand under.)
•Adjust seat-loading patterns, as needed, to comply with physical
distancing requirements. Examples would include seating every other
ride vehicle or vehicle row, further limiting capacity on a ride to allow for
space between household groups, etc.
NOTE: When adjusting seat-loading patterns, the ride operator must
ensure the patron load distribution complies with the manufacturer’s
load/balance criteria.
•Board household members in the same vehicle when possible.
Passengers from different households must be at least six feet apart.
Household members do not need to be seated six feet apart.
•Consider eliminating single-rider lines as they are typically designed to
help fill in every open seat, which is likely inconsistent with physical
distancing.
•Carefully evaluate attractions that require time-consuming personal
harnessing like ropes courses, climbing walls, and steel-cable swing rides
because of the difficulty managing physical distancing during the
harnessing process. The increased cleaning and disinfecting of the
harnesses and other equipment between each use may also be difficult.
•As a general rule, workers should avoid physically assisting/lifting guests. If
a guest needs assistance, ask another household member to help.
(Workers may still need to physically assist/lift guests in the event of a ride
evacuation.)
•Workers conducting maintenance and inspection activities must be
provided with and utilize nonporous gloves and face coverings. After
inspection or maintenance activities are complete, the ride must be
thoroughly cleaned and disinfected prior to allowing patron access to
the ride.

Additional Considerations for Dining and 
Concessions 
•Operators must limit capacity at all indoor eating and drinking
establishments to 25% capacity.
•Park visitors are permitted to eat and drink only in designated dining
areas. Concession stands must be accompanied by additional
designated and shaded eating areas. Monitor and adjust to ensure
enough adequately spaced eating areas are available.
•Designated, indoor dining areas should increase fresh air circulation by
opening windows or doors, if possible, and in accordance with security
and safety protocols.
•Position tables indoors near windows and doors to maximize air
exchange and ventilation but avoid having air flow from where one
party is seated directly toward another party.
•Maximize the distance between designated, indoor dining tables well
beyond the required six feet, wherever possible, to minimize the risks from
customers eating indoors without face coverings. Consider the use of
impermeable barriers between service tables to protect customers from
each other and workers. For outdoor designated dining areas, maintain
physical distancing standards of at least six feet and as outlined in this
guidance.
•All workers in dining areas and concession stands must conduct frequent
handwashing and follow all required protocols for food handling and
preparation. All staff must be provided and wear gloves.
•Frequently clean and disinfect host stands and service areas.
•Provide mobile vendors with gloves and personal hand sanitizer. Ensure
food and beverage items sold are packaged in sealed containers.
Implement payment methods that minimize passing cards or cash back
and forth (use exact cash, do not use payment systems that require
signature, etc.)
•Only place pre-packaged food in self-service counters. Add signs that
remind guests to only handle what they intend to purchase. For added
safety and to reduce contact, consider removing pre-packaged items
and make them only available from a worker.
•If beepers or pagers are used to manage waiting times, disinfect them
between each use. Message guests on their phones rather than use
beepers or pagers, when possible.
•Replace reusable menus with single-use, disposable paper menus, or
menu signs.

----------------Page (16) Break----------------
•Wrap silverware or plasticware individually within a napkin so people are
not picking them out of a group of utensils in a basket, cup, or box.
•Reduce seating to support physical distancing in seating areas.
•E         ncourage guests to order/pay for food and beverage through mobile
devices, whenever possible, and make items available for counter pick-
up. Use visual cues to ensure guests maintain physical distances of at
least six feet while waiting in line. Install impermeable barriers at quick
service restaurants, carts, kiosks and concession stand counters, if
possible.
Additional Considerations for Performances, 
Interactive Exhibits, and Events 
•Limit performances per day to allow for sufficient time to implement
cleaning and disinfecting protocols.
•Disinfect microphones and stands, podiums, and other equipment
between each show. Consult equipment manufacturers to determine
appropriate disinfection steps, particularly for soft, porous surfaces such
as foam earmuffs.
•To the extent it is consistent with the facility’s obligations to individuals
with disabilities, discontinue the use of equipment lent to guests unless it
can be properly disinfected after each use.
•Implement a reservation system to ensure the venue can maintain the
required capacity limits and monitor the number of attendees in the
venue, theater, or performance area to ensure physical distancing can
be maintained. Designate arrival times as part of reservations, if possible,
so that guests arrive at and enter the venue in staggered groups. Where
there is queuing, ensure guests are at least six feet apart.
•Establish directional entry and exit into the performance area whenever
possible. Operators must install Plexiglass dividers on all switchback lines.
•Allow extra time for guests to enter venues, theaters, and forums to
facilitate the new seating arrangements.
•Reconfigure close seats or otherwise remove seats from use to ensure
physical distancing of at least six feet between guests. This may require
seating every other row or blocking off or removing seats in a
“checkerboard” style (use each row but make sure no one is directly
behind other patrons) so that distances are maintained in all directions.
Members of the same household may be seated together but should
maintain at least six feet of distance from other households.

• Dedicate staff to help people maintain distances during activities. This 
could include ushering to seats prior to the start of a show and dismissing 
guests in an orderly fashion to reduce the crossflow of traffic. Manage 
egress by inviting guests nearest exits to leave seating areas first.  
• Review procedures for close contact meet-and-greet interactions with 
costume characters or animals based on physical distancing 
requirements and adherence to the CDPH Face Covering Guidance. 
Consider cancelling post show meet-and-greets. Modify photo 
opportunities and sets to maintain a minimum of six feet of distance 
between workers and guests.  
• For walk-through exhibits (museums, aquariums, etc.): 
o Monitor entrance and venue capacity to ensure guests can 
maintain physical distancing within the space. 
o Consider limiting the amount of time guests can remain in the exhibit 
to allow for other guests to enter. 
o Consider implementing a one-way traffic flow through the exhibit 
when practical. 
o Frequently clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces and viewing 
windows. 
o Consider providing hand sanitizer and/or handwashing stations 
throughout the exhibit. 
 
Additional Considerations for Uniform, 
Costume, and Wardrobe Protocols 
• Follow guidance for hair salons and barbershops available on the 
Industry Guidance to Reduce Risk website. 
• Ensure that only the costume or wardrobe department, if applicable, 
touches clothing and other items until a costume is fitted for and 
assigned to a worker. Develop a process to ensure each individual 
worker’s costume is kept separately from others’ costumes and supplies. 
Keep each worker’s costume and wardrobe in separate, labeled plastic 
bags.  
• Workers handling dirty linens or laundry must wear disposable gloves that 
are discarded after each use and must wash hands immediately after 
gloves are removed. Do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the 
possibility of dispersing virus through the air.

• Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer’s 
instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate 
water setting for the items and dry items completely. 
• Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for 
surfaces. If possible, consider placing a bag liner that is either disposable 
or can be laundered. 
• All hair and makeup workers must be provided face coverings and the 
appropriate protective equipment, including face shields, eye goggles, 
and disposable gloves where necessary.  
• Workers receiving hair or makeup services must wear face coverings any 
time it does not interfere with the service, unless exempted per the CDPH 
Face Covering Guidance. Face coverings with earloops, where possible, 
are encouraged to minimize the interference with hair services. 
• Workstations must be routinely and frequently cleaned, including 
between each use. Thoroughly clean and disinfect the station counters, 
rolling carts, drawers, hand mirrors, hair care and other products, and 
containers and provide a new smock or cape for each individual.  
• Thoroughly clean hair extensions or wigs according to the 
manufacturer’s directions after each use. 
• Purchase makeup application tools and supplies per worker and use 
them only on that individual. Keep these supplies in individual bags. 
• Mix foundation, powders, lipstick, and other makeup items on a 
disposable palette for each individual. Use disposable, single-use 
applicators for each person (e.g. mascara wands, lip brushes, eyeliner 
sticks, cotton swabs, powder puffs, etc.).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Amusement parks 
must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well 
as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California 
Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers must be prepared to alter their 
operations as those guidelines change.
