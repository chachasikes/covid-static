 Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to stay 
home. 
 Provide and ensure workers use face coverings and all necessary PPE. 
 Encourage frequent handwashing and use of hand sanitizer. 
 Provide disposable gloves to workers as a supplement to frequent hand washing 
for tasks such as handling commonly touched items or conducting symptom 
screening. 
 Restrict non-employees entering the facility to only those classified as essential by 
management.  
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
 Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas.  
 Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces. 
 Clean and sanitize all tools and shared equipment between each use. 
 Coordinate cleaning product use with the USDA and/or FDA if used in food 
production areas. 
 Clean touchable surfaces between shifts or between users, whichever is more 
frequent. 
 Ensure delivery vehicles and equipment are cleaned before and after delivery 
routes and carry sufficient sanitation materials. 
 Avoid sharing tools and other items. If shared, clean and disinfect. 
 Sanitize hard hats and face shields at the end of each shift. 
 Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times.  
 Ensure employees have ready access to sanitizer and other sanitary items they 
may need.  
 Ensure all water systems are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown to 
minimize risk of Legionnaires’ disease. 
 Clean floors using a vacuum with HEPA filter or other methods that do not 
disperse pathogens into the air. 
 Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shifts. 
 Stagger breaks and provide additional sanitary facilities if needed to maintain 
physical distancing during scheduled breaks. 
----------------Page (1) Break----------------
 Use products approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and train workers on chemical hazards, product 
instructions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements. Follow CDPH 
asthma-safer cleaning methods. 
 Consider upgrades to improve air filtration and ventilation.  
 If fans are used in the facility, ensure that fans blow clean air at the workers' 
breathing zone. 
 Modify offerings in on-site cafeterias, including prepackaged foods and flatware. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
 Implement measures to physically separate workers by at least six feet using 
measures such as physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored 
tape, or signs to indicate to where workers should stand). 
 Modify the alignment of workstations, including along processing lines so workers 
are at least six feet apart in all directions. 
 Install physical barriers, such as strip curtains, Plexiglas or similar materials between 
workers. 
 Designate workers to monitor and facilitate distancing. 
 If necessary to ensure physical distancing, increase the number of shifts in a day, 
slow down the line speeds, and space out workers in accordance with CDC 
guidelines. 
 Consider cohorting (grouping together) workers to always work together. 
 Limit the number of workers in enclosed areas. 
 Delineate one-way pathways to prevent employees from coming into close 
contact in narrow hallways. 
 Stagger start times and alternate locker locations to increase physical distancing 
inside locker rooms and at the time clock. 
 Reconfigure, restrict or close common areas and create alternative space for 
breaks where physical distancing is possible. 
 Stagger employee breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to 
maintain physical distancing protocols.  
 Adjust in-person meetings, if they are necessary, to ensure physical distancing. 
Provide virtual meeting and training opportunities if possible. 
 Keep drivers in their trucks while on property, with a non-contact delivery protocol 
at the security gate. 
 Adjust delivery and pickup processes to minimize contact.  
 Encourage workers to avoid carpooling to and from work, if possible.
