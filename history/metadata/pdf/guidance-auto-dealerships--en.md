OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at 
home to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that 
may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those 
with serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, 
are at higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most 
likely when people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an 
infected person, even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet 
developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available 
at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, 
indicating that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. 
Examples of these workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, 
food production, warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken 
to ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible, 
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not 
required) and customers/clients, 
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, 
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention 
plan. 
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for automobile dealerships and rental operators 
to support a safe, clean environment for workers. 
NOTE: Automotive dealerships and renters that operate repair and/or 
car washing operations should follow the guidance for limited service 
providers available on the COVID-19 Resilience Roadmap website.

The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to
public health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. 
Cal/OSHA has more safety and health guidance on their Cal/OSHA Guidance on 
Requirements to Protect Workers from Coronavirus webpage. CDC has additional 
guidance for businesses and employers. 
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or
distribution to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance;
•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When
no passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering 
requirements in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful 
workplace. Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers 
for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one 
of the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise 
be required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others 
cannot wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-
restrictive alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom 
edge, if feasible, and if the medical condition permits it.

Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude 
any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is 
complying with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling 
these exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Workplace Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at 
every facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas 
and work tasks, and designate a person at each facility to implement 
the plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
facility is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the workplace for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as 
needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace 
has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) 
and close contacts. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in 
workplace illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed 
or limited. 
Topics for Worker Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to 
contracting the virus. 
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks 
using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work:

o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, 
such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty 
breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of 
taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR 
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone 
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered 
potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 10 
days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms have 
improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of fever 
reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without symptoms 
who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only if 10 days 
have passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 test. 
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, 
including scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer 
with at least 60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product 
is inaccessible to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a 
sink or handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time 
(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do 
not replace the need for physical distancing and frequent 
handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or 
discarded after each shift.

• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, 
and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face 
coverings. Training should also include the employer’s policies on how 
people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will be 
handled. 
• Ensure any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at 
the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies 
and have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities 
ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract 
workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to 
receive that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See 
additional information on government programs supporting sick leave 
and worker’s compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave 
rights under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and workers’ 
rights to workers’ compensation benefits and presumption of the work-
relatedness of COVID-19 pursuant to the Governor’s Executive Order N-
62-20 while that Order is in effect. 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers 
entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom 
screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible. 
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative 
to providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was 
performed prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and 
follows CDC guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training 
section above. 
• Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to 
stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful 
to supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples 
are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling 
commonly touched items.

• Employers must take reasonable measures, including posting signage in 
strategic and highly-visible locations, to remind the public that they 
must use face coverings and practice physical distancing, and that 
they should frequently wash their hands with soap for at least 20 
seconds use hand sanitizer, and not touch their face. 
• Remind guests in advance to bring a face covering and make them 
available to anyone who arrives without one, if possible. 
• Customers and visitors to showrooms and shared work areas should be 
temperature and/or symptom screened upon arrival, asked to use hand 
sanitizer, and to wear a face covering. Face coverings should be 
provided to guests who arrive without them. 
• Display a set of clearly visible rules for guests at entrance(s) that are to 
be a condition of entry. The rules could include instructions to use hand 
sanitizer, wear face coverings during the visit, maintain physical 
distance from workers and other guests/groups, avoid unnecessary 
touching of surfaces, contact information for the local health 
department, and changes to services. Whenever possible, the rules 
should be available digitally and include pictograms. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas such as showrooms, 
waiting areas, break rooms, and areas of ingress and egress including 
stairways and elevator controls. Frequently disinfect commonly used 
surfaces, including counters, credit card machines, touchscreens, 
doorknobs, armrests, toilets, handwashing facilities, door handles, 
vehicle keys, and vehicles displayed in the showroom (door handles, 
seat adjustment controls, radio). 
• Clean touchable surfaces between shifts or between users, whichever 
is more frequent, including but not limited to working surfaces, keys, 
and stationary and mobile equipment controls. 
• Avoid sharing phones, tablets, office equipment, or tools 
wherever possible. Never share PPE. 
• Regularly clean and sanitize shared equipment, such as time 
clocks, payment portals, pens, and styluses between each use. 
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their 
shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours 
as part of the worker’s job duties. 
• Equip terminals, desks, and help counters with proper sanitation

products, including hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes, and provide 
personal hand sanitizers to all staff directly assisting customers. 
• Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all 
times and provide additional hand sanitizer when needed. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use products 
approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. Use 
disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral 
pathogens, diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per 
gallon of water),or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are 
appropriate for the surface. Provide workers training on the chemical 
hazards, manufacturer’s directions, ventilation requirements, and 
Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or 
disinfectants should wear gloves as required by the product 
instructions. Follow the asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended 
by the California Department of Public Health and ensure proper 
ventilation. 
• Provide hand sanitizer dispensers throughout showrooms, lobbies, 
and service areas, for use by customers and workers. 
• Dedicate workers to sanitize vehicles returning from rental and test 
drives as well as other high-touch surfaces in lobbies, showrooms, 
and offices. 
• Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods 
that can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA 
filter on facility and automobile surfaces wherever possible. 
• Use protective barriers such as disposable mats and seat covers when 
applicable, such as during test drives and moving returned vehicles. 
• Adjust or modify store hours to provide adequate time for regular deep 
cleaning. 
• Install and encourage the use of credit cards and hands-free devices, if 
possible, including motion sensor lights, contactless payment systems, 
automatic soap and paper towel dispensers, and timecard systems. 
• Inspect deliveries and take all necessary and feasible disinfection 
measures when receiving goods. 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the 
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other 
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in 
offices and other spaces.

Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between workers and customers. This can include use of physical 
partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored tape, or signs to 
indicate where workers and/or workers should stand). 
• Take measures in areas where physical distancing cannot be 
maintained to minimize exposure between workers and customers, such 
as Plexiglas or other appropriate barriers, if feasible. 
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., 
managing inventory rather than working as a cashier or managing 
administrative needs through telework). 
• Adjust meetings to ensure physical distance and use smaller individual 
meetings at facilities to maintain physical distancing guidelines. 
Decrease the capacity for conference and meeting rooms in order to 
maintain at least six feet of physical distance between workers. 
• Close or restrict common areas where personnel are likely to 
congregate and interact, such as kitchenettes and break rooms. Close 
self-service coffee, water, and snack areas, unless they are capable of 
dispensing without physical touching. Where possible, create outdoor break 
areas with shade covers and seating that ensures physical distancing. 
• Reconfigure office spaces, cubicles, etc. to ensure workspaces allow for 
six feet between workers. Provide a single, clearly designated entrance 
and separate exit to help maintain physical distancing, wherever 
possible. 
• Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas 
like supply closets, to ensure at least six feet of separation to limit 
transmission of the virus. 
• Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, 
to maintain physical distancing protocols. 
• Adjust maximum occupancy rules based on the size of your facility to 
limit the number of people in a store, office, or showroom at one time. 
Capacity limits should be low enough to ensure physical distancing but in no 
case more than 50% maximum occupancy. 
• Limit passengers in the vehicle during test drives to only a single 
customer with the worker sitting in opposite back seat, when 
applicable.

• Encourage customer appointments and have customers practice 
physical distancing while waiting for service using visual cues orask 
customers to wait in their vehicles. 
• Offer curbside delivery or pickup and move sales and agreements to 
remote/digital platforms as feasible. 
• Limit shuttle services whenever possible. Employers should follow this 
guidance in addition to applicable transit guidance as it becomes 
available on the COVID-19 Resilience Roadmap website. 
• Require workers to not use handshakes and similar greetings that break 
physical distance. 
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Employers must 
comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as 
guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California 
Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers must be prepared to alter 
their operations as those guidelines change.
