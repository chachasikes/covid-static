and change frequently.

kitchens with proper sanitation products, including hand sanitizer and sanitizing 
wipes and ensure availability. 
 Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times.

than disinfecting) food contact surfaces.

 Open windows and consider upgrades to improve air filtration and ventilation. 
 Clean floors using a vacuum with HEPA filter or other methods that do not 
disperse pathogens into the air.

devices. 
 Provide table settings (e.g., napkins, cutlery, glassware, etc.) to customers only as 
needed.

 Adjust maximum occupancy rules and implement measures to physically 
separate workers and customers by at least six feet using measures such as 
reconfiguring space, installing physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor 
markings, colored tape, or signs to indicate to where workers should stand). 
 Limit the number of patrons at a single table. 
 Install physical barriers where maintaining physical distance of six feet is difficult. 
 Clearly mark areas where people queue for appropriate physical distancing.
