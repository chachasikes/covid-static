Individual Control Measures & Screening 
 Symptom screenings and/or temperature checks. 
 Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to stay 
home. 
 Encourage frequent handwashing and use of hand sanitizer. 
 Provide disposable gloves to workers as a supplement to frequent hand washing 
for  tasks such as handling commonly touched items or conducting symptom 
screening. 
 Provide and ensure workers use face coverings and all necessary PPE. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
 Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas and frequently disinfect 
commonly used surfaces. 
 Clean and sanitize touchable surfaces and shared equipment between shifts or 
users, whichever is more frequent.  
 Provide hand sanitizer, sanitizing wipes and other sanitary supplies and locate 
them where they are readily available to workers. 
 Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times.  
 Use products approved for COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA)-approved list and train workers on chemical hazards, product instructions, 
ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements. Follow CDPH asthma-safer 
cleaning methods. 
 Clean delivery vehicles and equipment before and after delivery, provide 
sanitation materials during deliveries, and identify alternative restroom locations 
on routes. 
 Provide working time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their 
shifts. 
 Inspect deliveries and perform disinfection measures where appropriate prior to 
storing goods in warehouses and facilities. 
 Clean floors using a vacuum with HEPA filter or other methods that do not 
disperse pathogens into the air. 
 Consider upgrades to improve air filtration and ventilation.

Physical Distancing Guidelines 
 Implement measures to physically separate workers by at least six feet using 
measures such as physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored 
tape, or signs to indicate to where workers should stand). 
 Minimize transaction time between warehouse workers and transportation 
personnel; perform gate check-ins and paperwork digitally, if feasible.  
 Adjust in-person meetings, if they are necessary, to ensure physical distancing. 
 Stagger employee breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to 
maintain physical distancing protocols.  
 Reconfigure, restrict or close common areas and create alternative space for 
breaks where physical distancing is possible. 
 Use the following hierarchy to prevent transmission of COVID-19 in work areas 
especially where physical distancing is difficult to maintain: engineering controls, 
administrative controls, and PPE. 
 Utilize work practices, when feasible, to limit the number of workers on the jobsite 
at one time.  
 Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas.
