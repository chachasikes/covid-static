Order is in effect. 
 Train any independent contractors, temporary or contract workers, and 
volunteers in these policies and ensure they have necessary PPE. 
Individual Control Measures & Screening 
 Symptom screenings and/or temperature checks for workers and the public. 
 Encourage workers and members of the public who are sick or exhibiting 
symptoms of COVID-19 to stay home. 
 Encourage frequent handwashing and use of hand sanitizer. 
 Consider providing gloves as a supplement to frequent hand washing for tasks 
such as handling commonly touched items or conducting symptom screening. 
Workers should wear gloves when handling items contaminated by body fluids. 
 Remind guests to bring a face covering. Provide face coverings to people who 
do not bring one. 
 Post signage in highly visible locations to remind the public that they must use 
face covers, practice physical distancing, not touch their face, frequently wash 
their hands with soap for at least 20 seconds, and to use hand sanitizer. Also post 
this information on websites and promotional materials. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
 Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas.  
 Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces. 
 Clean and sanitize shared equipment between each use. 
 Clean touchable surfaces between shifts or between users, whichever is more 
frequent. 
 Provide hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes at terminals, desks, and help counters. 
Provide personal hand sanitizer to all staff who directly assist customers. 
 Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times.  
 Make hand sanitizer and other sanitary supplies readily available to employees.  
 Use products approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and train workers on chemical hazards, product 
instructions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements. Follow CDPH 
asthma-safer cleaning methods. 
 Ensure all water systems are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown to 
minimize risk of Legionnaires’ disease. 
 Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shifts. 
 Provide hand sanitizer throughout reception areas, lobbies, gaming tables, 
restaurant entrances, meeting and convention spaces, elevator lobbies,

employee breakrooms, employee time clock locations, cages, showrooms, 
lobbies, and service areas, for use by customers and employees. 
 Modify table or machine operating hours to provide adequate time for regular 
thorough cleaning. 
 Install hands-free devices if possible, such as no-touch trash cans and hand soap 
dispensers, and allow adequate time for handwashing. 
 Encourage the use of debit or credit cards by customers. 
 Inspect deliveries and take all necessary and feasible disinfection measures when 
receiving goods. 
 Clean floors using a vacuum with HEPA filter or other methods that do not 
disperse pathogens into the air. 
 Consider upgrades to improve air filtration and ventilation. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
 Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet between 
workers and customers, using measures such as physical partitions or visual cues 
(e.g., floor markings, colored tape, or signs to indicate to where workers should 
stand). 
 Where physical distancing cannot be maintained, use barriers such as Plexiglas. 
 Display signage at various locations to remind customers of physical distancing, 
proper use of face coverings, and hand hygiene at every opportunity. 
 Decrease the capacity for meeting rooms to ensure physical distancing. 
 Close breakrooms, use barriers, or spread out chairs and discourage 
congregating during breaks. Create outdoor break areas with shade and 
seating, if possible. 
 Reconfigure office spaces, gaming tables, cashier’s cages, meeting rooms, etc., 
to ensure workspaces allow for six feet between employees and guests. 
 Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas to ensure 
at least six feet of separation. 
 Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to 
maintain physical distancing protocols.  
 Close self-service coffee, water, and snack areas, unless guests and workers are 
capable of dispensing without physical touching. 
 Provide a single clearly designated entrance and separate exit to help maintain 
physical distancing when possible.

Additional Guidelines for Interactions with 
Members of the Public  
 Place hand sanitizing stations in all high traffic areas and other areas where 
queueing and handling of chips, cards, money, tickets, etc., will occur. 
 When members of the public and workers pass items back and forth for an 
extended period of time (such as cards or chips), ensure frequent use of hand 
sanitizer and remind members of the public (with signs and/or verbally) not to 
touch their eyes, nose, and mouth. Consider providing gloves at each table for 
use by members of the public. Provide a means of disposal at each location 
where gloves or other materials are provided. 
 Provide time between dealer rotations to allow for thorough handwashing. 
 For card games where players touch the cards, upon dealer rotation, discard 
cards in play, sanitize them, or keep them out of rotation for at least 7 days. For 
card games where players do not touch the cards, after at least 8 hours, discard, 
disinfect, sanitize, or take cards out of rotation for at least 7 days. The dealer must 
use hand sanitizer prior to beginning play at each card table and immediately at 
the conclusion of the table rotation. 
 Replace chips with clean chips upon every dealer rotation, and wash and 
disinfect used chips. 
 Remove tables, chairs, machines, gaming tables, etc., from guest areas so that six 
feet of physical distance can be maintained for customers and workers wherever 
possible. If such items cannot be moved, use visual cues to show that they are not 
available for use or install Plexiglas or other types of impermeable physical 
barriers. 
 Reduce the number of occupants at gaming tables so that guests have 
increased physical distance. Do not allow spectators who are not playing. 
 Do not provide meal service at gaming tables. Take and deliver drink orders to 
customers. When serving drinks at tables with guests from different households, 
provide beverages in lidded containers. 
 Close betting windows to allow six feet of separation. Consider opening 
additional locations in alternative venues to increase physical distancing and 
provide sanitation stations at the alternative venues. 
 Reconfigure racetrack seating areas and close sections. Use physical barriers 
where necessary. 
 Provide resources to promote personal hygiene of members of the public, 
including tissues, no-touch trashcans, hand soap, adequate locations for 
handwashing, alcohol-based hand sanitizers, disinfectants, and disposable 
towels.
