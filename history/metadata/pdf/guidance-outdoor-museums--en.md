OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that 
person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not required)
and customers/clients/visitors,
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for outdoor museums, open air galleries, botanical 
gardens, and other outdoor exhibition spaces to support a safe, clean environment for 
workers. 
NOTE: This guidance is not intended for zoos, amusement parks, or indoor gallery 
and museum spaces. Each of those types of establishments should remain closed 
until they are allowed to resume modified or full operation through a specific 
reopening order and guidance. Outdoor museums and galleries with indoor 
exhibits, gift shops, cafes, restaurants, convention space, etc. should keep those 
areas closed until each of those types of establishments is allowed to resume

modified or full operation. Employers should refer to appropriate guidelines for 
retail, restaurants, etc., as they become available. 
Indoor museums and galleries, zoos, and aquariums in counties whose health 
officer has approved further reopening may follow applicable guidance on 
the COVID-19 County Roadmap website. 
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public 
health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA 
has more comprehensive guidance on their Cal/OSHA General Guidelines on 
Protecting Workers from COVID-19 webpage. CDC has additional requirements in their 
guidance for businesses and employers. 
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution
to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance;
•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no
passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering requirements 
in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. 
Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the 
reasonable cost of obtaining them.

----------------Page (2) Break----------------
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one of 
the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot 
wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if 
feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude 
any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying 
with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these 
exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Workplace Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at 
every location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work 
areas and work tasks, and designate a person at each location to 
implement the plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
operation is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the location for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan 
as needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a 
workplace has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive 
worker(s) and close contacts. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
Topics for Worker and Volunteer Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to 
contracting the virus. 
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks, 
using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work: 
o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 described by the CDC, 
such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty

breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of 
taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea, OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR 
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with 
someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is 
considered potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 
10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms 
have improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of 
fever reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without 
symptoms who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only 
if 10 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 
test. 
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including 
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible 
to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or 
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time 
(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not 
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or discarded 
after each shift.

• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, 
and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face 
coverings. Training should also include the employer’s policies on how 
people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will be 
handled. 
• Ensure any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at 
the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and 
have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of 
time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to 
receive that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See 
additional information on government programs supporting sick leave 
and worker’s compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick 
leave rights under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and 
workers’ rights to workers’ compensation benefits and presumption of 
the work-relatedness of COVID-19 pursuant to the 
Governor’s Executive Order N-62-20 while that Order is in effect. 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers 
(including docents, interns, volunteers, etc.) at the beginning of their shift. 
Make sure the temperature/symptom screener avoids close contact with 
workers to the extent possible. 
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate 
alternative to providing it at the establishment, ensure that 
screening was performed prior to the worker leaving the home for 
their shift and follows CDC guidelines, as described in the Topics for 
Worker Training section above. 
• Encourage workers, volunteers, and visitors who are sick or exhibiting 
symptoms of COVID-19 to stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers and volunteers use all 
required protective equipment, including eye protection and 
gloves where necessary. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to 
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are 
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly 
touched items.

• Outdoor museum and gallery operators must take reasonable 
measures, including posting signage at all entrances and in strategic 
and highly-visible locations and in reservation confirmations, to remind 
the public that they must use face coverings and practice physical 
distancing during their visit and that they should frequently wash their 
hands with soap for at least 20 seconds, use hand sanitizer, and not 
touch their face. 
• Remind guests in advance to bring a face covering and make them 
available to anyone who arrives without one, if possible. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Frequently disinfect commonly touched surfaces such as grab bars, 
railings, placards, light switches, door handles, etc. 
• Clean outdoor surfaces made of plastic or metal. Do not spray 
disinfectant on playgrounds, wooden surfaces, or sidewalks, 
as recommended by the CDC. 
• Perform thorough cleaning of any indoor work areas that workers must 
use or occupy in order to maintain operations of outdoor exhibits. This 
should include high traffic areas and shared workspaces (offices, 
meeting rooms, break rooms, etc.), and areas of ingress and egress 
(handrails, stairways, elevator controls, etc.) 
• Avoid sharing phones, tablets, two-way radios, other work supplies, or 
office equipment wherever possible. Never share PPE. 
• Where such items must be shared, disinfect with a cleaner 
appropriate for the surface between shifts or uses, whichever is 
more frequent, including the following: shared office equipment, 
such as copiers, fax machines, printers, telephones, keyboards, 
terminals, ATM PIN pads, staplers, staple removers, letter openers, 
surfaces in reception areas, shared work stations, audio and 
video equipment (microphones, microphone stands, mixer 
boards, TV monitors), walkie talkies, etc. 
• Instruct workers to wipe down and disinfect equipment that passes 
between workers and customers/visitors such as pens, reusable maps, 
etc. 
• Provide disposable or single-use maps, pamphlets, guides, etc. to 
customers/visitors and make these available digitally so that 
customers/visitors can view on a personal electronic device, if possible. If 
single-use items cannot be provided, properly disinfect reusable ones

before and after customer use. 
• To the extent it is consistent with the business’s obligations to individuals 
with disabilities, discontinue the use of audio headsets, strollers, etc., and 
other equipment lent to customers/visitors unless it can be properly 
disinfected after each use. Consult equipment manufacturers to 
determine appropriate disinfection steps, particularly for soft, porous 
surfaces such as foam earmuffs. 
• Equip workplace terminals with proper sanitation products, including 
hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes. 
• Ensure that sanitary facilities for workers and guests stay operational and 
stocked at all times and provide additional soap, paper towels, and 
hand sanitizer when needed. Provide hand sanitizer for visitors where 
possible at high traffic areas such as entrances. 
• Install and encourage the use of hands-free devices, if possible, including 
motion sensor lights and automatic soap and paper towel dispensers. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use products 
approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. Use 
disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, 
diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or 
alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the 
surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, 
manufacturer’s directions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA 
requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should 
wear gloves as required by the product instructions. Follow the asthma-
safer cleaning recommended by the California Department of Public 
Health and ensure proper ventilation. 
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their 
shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as 
part of the workers’ job duties. 
• Modify hours, if necessary, to ensure regular, thorough cleaning of 
workspaces, as appropriate. Procure options for third-party cleaning 
companies to assist with the increased cleaning demand, as needed. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between workers and customers/visitors and between customers 
waiting in lines. This can include use of physical partitions, Plexiglas

barriers, or visual cues (e.g., floor markings or signs to indicate to where 
workers and customers/visitors should stand). 
• Designate separate routes for entry and exit into outdoor exhibits, 
galleries, and indoor worker workspaces to help maintain physical 
distancing and lessen the instances of people closely passing each 
other, if possible. Establish directional hallways and passageways for foot 
traffic, if possible, to eliminate workers and guests from passing by one 
another. 
• Dedicate staff to direct guests at high traffic and bottleneck areas 
to avoid congregating. Adjust maximum occupancy rules to limit 
the number of people at outdoor museums and galleries as 
appropriate to support physical distancing. 
• Consider implementing timed and/or advanced reservation ticketing 
systems to stagger patron visits and help maintain physical distances. 
• Limit visitor group size to six or fewer. People from the same household do 
not need to be six feet apart. 
• Discontinue tours that combine individuals from different households into 
the same tour group. Tour guides must maintain at least six feet of 
physical distance from customers/visitors. 
• Rearrange seating areas and/or remove seats to allow for a minimum of 
six feet of physical distance between customers/visitors. Post signage at 
shared, immovable seating (benches, etc.) to remind customers/visitors 
to physically distance from others outside their party. 
• Close interactive exhibits, playgrounds, etc. where physical contact is 
necessary and customers or visitors may congregate. 
• Consider offering workers, docents, interns, and volunteer staff who 
request modified duties options that minimize their contact with 
customers and other workers (e.g., managing inventory rather than 
working as a cashier or managing administrative needs through 
telework). 
• Utilize work practices, when feasible and necessary, to limit the number of 
workers at the office at one time. This may include scheduling (e.g., 
staggering start/end times), establishing alternating days for on-site 
reporting, returning to workspaces in phases, or continued use of telework 
when feasible. 
• Reconfigure office spaces, workstations, check-out counters, etc. to 
allow for at least six feet between workers while at their workstations. 
• Reconfigure, restrict or close breakrooms and create alternative space

for breaks where physical distancing is possible. Discourage workers 
from congregating in high traffic areas such as bathrooms and hallways. 
Limit the number of workers riding in an elevator at a time. 
• Discourage workers and visitors from congregating in high traffic 
areas such as bathrooms and hallways. 
• Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour 
regulations, to maintain physical distancing protocols. 
• Avoid sharing vehicles when traveling on the property. 
• Eliminate person-to-person contact for delivery of goods to worksites. 
• Avoid touching others’ pens and clipboards. If possible, install transfer-
aiding materials, such as shelving and bulletin boards, to reduce person-
to-person hand-offs. 
• Redesign parking lots to limit congregation points and ensure proper 
separation (e.g. every other space, contactless payment, etc.) 
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Employers must 
comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as 
guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California 
Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers must be prepared to alter their 
operations as those guidelines change.
