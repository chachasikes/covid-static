July 29, 2020
All guidance should be implemented 
only with county health officer approval 
following their review of local 
epidemiological data including cases 
per 100,000 population, rate of test 
positivity, and local preparedness to 
support a health care surge, vulnerable 
populations, contact tracing, and 
testing.

OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at 
home to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that 
may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with 
serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at 
higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when 
people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, 
even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available 
at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating 
that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of 
these workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not required) and
customers/clients,
frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for hair salons and barbershops to support a safe, 
clean, outdoor environment for workers and customers. Hair salon or barbershop 
owners or operators must acknowledge that lessees should only resume operations 
when they are ready and able to implement the necessary safety measures to 
provide for their safety and that of their customers. The guidance is not intended to 
revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, regulatory or collectively 
bargained and is not exhaustive, as it does not include county health orders, nor is it 
a substitute for any existing safety and health-related regulatory requirements such as 
those of Cal/OSHA or the California Board of Barbering and Cosmetology.1 Stay 
----------------Page (1) Break----------------
current on changes to public health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-
19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has more comprehensive guidance on their 
Cal/OSHA General Guidelines on Protecting Workers from COVID-19 webpage. CDC 
has additional requirements in their guidance for businesses and employers. 
Outdoor operations may be conducted under a tent, canopy, or other sun
shelter as long as no more than one side is closed, allowing sufficient outdoor
air movement.
Salons and barbershops should not perform a service that would require a
customer to have to enter the establishment.
Required Use of Face Coverings
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure.  
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
Interacting in-person, indoor or outdoor, with any member of the public;
Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or
distribution to others;
Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance; or,
Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When
no passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering 
requirements in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful 
workplace. Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers 
for the reasonable cost of obtaining them.   
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one 
----------------Page (2) Break----------------
 
of the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot 
wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if 
feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude 
any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying 
with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these 
exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers. 
 
 
----------------Page (3) Break----------------
 
 
Workplace Specific Plan 
 Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every 
location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and 
work tasks, and designate a person at each facility to implement the plan. 
 Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
 Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
facility is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers or customers. 
 Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
 Regularly evaluate the facility for compliance with the plan and document 
and correct deficiencies identified. 
 Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related factors 
could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as needed to 
prevent further cases. 
 Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has 
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
 Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) and 
close contacts. 
 Comply with the Cal/OSHA standard for heat illness prevention for outdoor 
workers, including an effective heat illness prevention plan with written 
procedures. See the Cal/OSHA heat illness prevention page for resources, 
including FAQs, a webinar, and a sample written plan. Elements of a heat 
illness prevent plan include: 
o Access to water 
o Access to shade  
o Cool down breaks 
o Emergency procedures for heat illness cases 
o Monitoring of employees who are acclimatizing during a heat wave 
o Training on heat illness prevention and symptoms 
 Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
 
 
Topics for Worker Training 
 Information  on COVID-19,  how to prevent  it  from  spreading,  and  which 
underlying  health  conditions  may  make  individuals  more  susceptible to 
contracting the virus. 
 Self-screening  at  home,  including  temperature  and/or  symptom checks 
using CDC Guidelines. 
 The importance of not coming to work: 
o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, such 
as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, 
fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, 
sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, 
OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR  
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone 
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered potentially 
infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
 To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 10 
days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms have 
improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of fever 
reducing medications) for the last 72 hours.  A worker without symptoms 
who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only if 10 days have 
passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 test.  
 To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
 The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including 
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible to 
unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or handwashing 
station, per CDC guidelines). 
 The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time (see 
Physical Distancing section below). 
 Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
----------------Page (5) Break----------------
 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not 
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or 
discarded after each shift 
 Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and 
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. 
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who 
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled. 
 Heat illness symptoms and prevention, following Cal/OSHA requirements.  
 Ensure independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers are also 
properly trained in COVID- 19 prevention policies and have necessary 
supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of time with 
organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers. 
 Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive 
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional 
information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers’ 
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under 
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act  and workers’ rights to workers’ 
compensation benefits and presumption of the work-relatedness of 
COVID-19 pursuant to the Governor’s Executive Order N-62-20 while that 
Order is in effect. 
 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
 Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers 
entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom screener 
avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible.  
 If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to 
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed 
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC 
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. 
 Encourage workers and customers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of 
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
 
COVID-19 to stay home. 
 Hair salon or barbershop operators must provide and ensure workers use all 
required protective equipment, including eye protection, face shields, and 
protective gloves when necessary. 
 Hair salon or barbershop operators should consider where disposable glove 
use may be helpful to supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand 
sanitizer; examples are for workers who are screening others for symptoms 
or handling commonly touched items. 
 Disposable gloves should be worn for services that require them. Wearing 
gloves should be done in conjunction with regular hand washing and is not 
a substitute for regular hand washing. 
 Workers should consider using glasses, goggles, or face shields in addition 
to face coverings during the provision of services, particularly during face 
to face encounters. 
 Contact customers before visits to confirm appointments and ask if they or 
someone in their household is exhibiting any COVID-19 symptoms. If the 
customer answers in the affirmative reschedule the appointment. Request 
customers to bring and use face coverings during the visit. If appropriate 
for the service, consider asking customers to come to the salon with their 
hair freshly cleaned in order to minimize time for the appointment. 
Customers should be asked not to bring children or others with them to the 
appointment. 
 Customers should be screened upon arrival. Be prepared to cancel or 
reschedule customers who indicate they have any signs of illness. 
 Display a set of guidelines for customers that are to be a condition of 
service. The guidelines must include instructions to wear face coverings, use 
hand sanitizer, maintain physical distance from other customers, and they 
should communicate changes to service offerings. The guidelines should 
be posted in clearly visible locations, including at entrances, include 
pictograms, and be made available digitally (e.g., through email). 
 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
 Coordinate with coworkers, fellow tenants, booth renters and/or workers 
and put a plan in place for cleaning at the beginning and end of each 
shift and in between customers. Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic 
areas, such as reception areas, and areas of ingress and egress including 
stairways, stairwells, and handrails. 
 Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces including credit card 
terminals, counters, reception area seating, door handles, light switches, 
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
 
phones, toilets, and handwashing facilities. 
 Encourage the use of credit cards and contactless payment systems. If 
electronic or card payment is not possible, customers should come with 
exact cash payment or check. 
 Consider upgrading to touchless faucets, soap and paper towel 
dispensers, and adding touchless, automatic hand sanitizer dispensers. 
Remove any unnecessary products that do not belong in the restroom, e.g. 
candles or beauty supplies, and ensure soap dispensers and paper towel 
dispensers are regularly filled. 
 To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated 
with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems are safe to use after 
a prolonged facility shutdown. 
 Amenities, including magazines, books, coffee, water, self-serve stations 
(unless touchless), and other items for customers, must be removed from 
reception areas to help reduce touch points and customer interactions. 
 Equip reception areas and workstations with proper sanitation products, 
including hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes. 
 Thoroughly clean any product display areas, including all shelving and 
display cases. Remove and discard any open “test” products and 
discontinue this practice to help reduce contamination. Add signage to 
this area to let customers know it is cleaned and disinfected daily. 
 Workstations must be routinely and frequently cleaned, including between 
each customer appointment. Thoroughly clean and disinfect the station 
counters, rolling carts, drawers, hand mirrors, hair care and other products, 
and containers and provide a new smock or cape for each customer. 
 Clean and disinfect shears by removing all visible debris, clean with soap 
and water, and wipe or spray with an EPA-registered disinfectant that 
demonstrates bactericidal, fungicidal, and virucidal activity and is 
approved for COVID-19. 
 Clean and disinfect all non-electrical tools by removing all visible debris, 
cleaning with soap and water, drying the tools, and then completely 
immersing them in an EPA registered disinfectant. Tools should be sprayed 
or submerged and left to set for the full amount of time required by the 
disinfectant’s manufacturer. Immersed items, like combs or brushes, should 
be removed at the end of contact time, rinsed, and dried with a paper 
towel or clean, freshly laundered towel. 
 Clean all electrical tools, such as clippers, by removing all visible debris and 
disinfecting with an EPA-registered disinfectant spray or wipe that 
demonstrates bactericidal, fungicidal, and virucidal activity and is 
approved for COVID-19. 
----------------Page (8) Break----------------
 
 Clean and disinfect all handles, hoses, spray nozzles, and other equipment 
before and after use on a customer. Chairs, headrests, shampoo bowls, 
and other items should also be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized between 
each use. 
 Where appropriate, consider adding a paper cover, sheet, or clean towel 
that can be easily disposed of or cleaned for use between customers. 
 All single use items, such as disposable wax collars, cotton, neck strips, and 
applicators, must be used once and immediately thrown away. Product 
samples, including make-up, must not be used at any time. 
 All dirty linens, including towels, smocks, and reusable capes, should be 
placed in a closed container and not used again until properly laundered 
either by a commercial laundering service or a laundering process which 
includes immersion in water of at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 
25 minutes. Store all clean linens in a clean, covered place. Ensure workers 
who handle dirty linens or laundry wear gloves. 
 Where possible, do not clean by sweeping or other methods that can 
disperse pathogens into the air. Vacuum wherever possible and use a 
vacuum with a HEPA filter. 
 Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift. 
Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as part of 
the worker’s job duties. 
 When choosing disinfecting chemicals, hair salon or barbershop operators 
should use products approved for use against COVID-19 on the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product 
instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral 
pathogens, diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of 
water), or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate 
for the surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, 
manufacturer’s directions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA 
requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should 
wear gloves and other protective equipment as required by the product. 
Follow the asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended by the 
California Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation. 
 Hair salon or barbershop workers should avoid sharing phones, tablets, 
laptops, desks, pens, other work supplies, wherever possible. Never share 
PPE. 
 Discontinue the use of shared food and beverage equipment in 
breakrooms (including shared coffee brewers). 
 Ensure any outdoor shade or outdoor working area has the same 
ventilation and airflow as the outdoors. Outdoor shaded areas can be 
configured to block wind but cannot be enclosed or partially enclosed on 
----------------Page (9) Break----------------
 
more than one side in a way that otherwise restricts normal airflow. 
 Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the 
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other 
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in all 
working areas. 
 In addition to the above cleaning and disinfecting protocols, hair salons, 
barbershops, and other cosmetology businesses must follow the existing 
California Board of Barbering and Cosmetology rules. 
 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
 Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between and among workers and customers, except when providing 
haircutting and other close contact services. This can include use of 
physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored tape, or signs 
to indicate to where workers and/or customers should stand). 
 Establish an outdoor reception area where customers can check in while 
still following physical distancing guidelines. Take measures at reception 
area or other areas where physical distancing cannot be maintained to 
minimize exposure between workers and customers, such as Plexiglas or 
other barriers. 
 Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., managing 
inventory or managing administrative needs through telework). 
 Stagger appointments to reduce reception congestion and ensure 
adequate time for proper cleaning and sanitation between each 
customer visit. Consider servicing fewer customers each day or expanding 
operating hours to allow for more time between customers. Suspend walk-
in appointment availability. 
 If possible, implement virtual check-in technology to ensure that workers 
are notified when a customer arrives. Do not allow customers to wait inside 
the salon or barbershop. Ask customers to wait in a designated area 
outside that permits necessary physical distancing or in their cars. 
 Require workers to avoid handshakes, hugs, or similar greetings that break 
physical distance. 
 Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade covers and seating 
that ensures physical distancing.  
 Adjust any staff meetings to ensure physical distancing. Hold meetings over 
the phone or via webinar for workers wherever possible. 
----------------Page (10) Break----------------
 
Other Considerations for Moving Work  
Outdoors 
 Rewiring and the use of electrical extension cords can increase the 
likelihood of electrical hazards, including fire and electrocution. Ensure that 
outdoor operations comply with Cal/OSHA and all code requirements. See 
Cal/OSHA’s Guide to Electrical Safety for more information. 
 Ensure there are no tripping hazards from cords or other equipment in 
outdoor work areas. 
 Use skin protection when not under shade. 
 Stop operations, move away from electrical wiring and equipment, and 
seek indoor shelter if there is lightning within 6 miles of your location (see 
the FEMA “30/30 rule”). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1 Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Hair salons and 
barbershops must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its 
guidance as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and 
the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers should be prepared 
to alter their operations as those guidelines change.
