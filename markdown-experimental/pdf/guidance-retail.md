OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that 
person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible, 
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not required) 
and customers/clients, 
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, 
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention 
plan. 
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for retailers to support a safe, clean environment for 
workers. The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either 
statutory, regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not 
include county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-
related regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes 
to public health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. 
Cal/OSHA has more safety and health guidance on their Cal/OSHA Guidance on 
Requirements to Protect Workers from Coronavirus webpage. CDC has additional 
guidance for businesses and employers and for food and grocery retailers.

Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution
to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance;
•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no
passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering requirements 
in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. 
Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the 
reasonable cost of obtaining them. 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one of 
the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot 
wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if 
feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude 
any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying 
with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these 
exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and worker

Workplace Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every 
location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and 
work tasks, and designate a person at each establishment to implement 
the plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
operation is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers or customers. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the establishment for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as 
needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a 
workplace has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive 
worker(s) and close contacts. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
Topics for Worker Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to 
contracting the virus. 
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks 
using CDC guidelines. 
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage.

• The importance of not coming to work: 
o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the 
CDC, such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, 
new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, 
nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR 
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with 
someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is 
considered potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 
10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms 
have improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of 
fever reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without 
symptoms who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only 
if 10 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 
test. 
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, 
including scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer 
with at least 60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the 
product is inaccessible to unsupervised children) when workers 
cannot get to a sink or handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time 
(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not 
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or discarded 
after each shift. 
• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings

must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and 
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. 
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who 
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled. 
• Ensure any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at 
the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and 
have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of 
time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive 
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional 
information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers’ 
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under 
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and workers’ rights to workers’ 
compensation benefits and presumption of the work-relatedness of 
COVID-19 pursuant to the Governor’s Executive Order N-62-20 while that 
Order is still in effect. 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers 
entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom 
screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible. 
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative 
to providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was 
performed prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and 
follows CDC guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training 
section above 
• Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to 
stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. This 
includes protections for cashiers, baggers, and other workers with 
regular and repeated interaction with customers. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful 
to supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples 
are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling 
commonly touched items. 
• Workers must also be provided and use protective equipment when 
offloading and storing delivered goods. Workers should inspect

deliveries and perform disinfection measures prior to storing goods in 
warehouses and facilities when there are signs of tampering. 
• Retailers must take reasonable measures, including posting signage in 
strategic and highly-visible locations, to remind the public that they 
must use face coverings and practice physical distancing. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas, such as break rooms, 
lunch areas and areas of ingress and egress including stairways, stairwells, 
escalators, handrails, and elevator controls. Frequently disinfect 
commonly used surfaces, including shopping carts, baskets, conveyor 
belts, registers (including self-checkout), scanners, register telephones, 
hand-held devices, counters, door handles, shelving, ATM PIN pads, 
customer assistance call buttons, handwashing facilities, etc. 
• Clean and sanitize shared equipment, including but not limited to, 
pallet jacks, ladders, supply carts, time clocks, payment portals, and 
styluses between each use. 
• Clean touchable surfaces between shifts or between users, whichever is 
more frequent, including but not limited to working surfaces, tools, and 
stationary and mobile equipment controls. 
• Equip customer entrances and exits, checkout stations, customer 
changing rooms with proper sanitation products, including hand 
sanitizer and sanitizing wipes, and provide personal hand sanitizers to 
all frontline staff (e.g., cashiers). 
• Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times 
and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when 
needed. 
• To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases 
associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and 
features (e.g., drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to 
use after a prolonged facility shutdown. 
• Provide resources to promote workers’ personal hygiene. This will 
include tissues, no-touch trash cans, hand soap, adequate time for 
hand-washing, alcohol-based hand sanitizers, disinfectants, and 
disposable towels. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use 
products approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product 
instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to be effective against

emerging viral pathogens, diluted household bleach solutions (5 
tablespoons per gallon of water), or alcohol solutions with at least 
70% alcohol that are appropriate for the surface. Provide workers 
training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer’s directions, 
ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. 
Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should wear gloves and other 
protective equipment as required by the product instructions. Follow 
the asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended by the California 
Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation. 
• Adjust or modify store hours to provide adequate time for regular, 
thorough cleaning and product stocking. Stagger stocking so that 
associates are in different aisles. 
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their 
shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as 
part of the workers’ job duties. Procure options for third-party cleaning 
companies to assist with the increased cleaning demand, as needed. 
• Install hands-free devices, if possible, including motion sensor lights, 
contactless payment systems, automatic soap and paper towel 
dispensers, and timecard systems. 
• Encourage the use of debit or credit cards by customers, for 
example, through signage. 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading 
the building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making 
other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and 
ventilation in offices and other spaces. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Retailers should create clearly-marked curbside or outside pickup points 
that maintain physical distance with visual cues or other measures, and 
have purchased goods available there or available through home 
delivery. 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between workers and customers. This can include use of physical partitions 
or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored tape, or signs to indicate to 
where workers and/or customers should stand). 
• Take measures at checkout stations to minimize exposure between 
cashiers and customers, such as Plexiglas barriers. 
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., managing 
inventory rather than working as a cashier or managing administrative

needs through telework). 
• Adjust in-person meetings, if they are necessary, to ensure physical 
distancing and use smaller individual meetings at facilities to maintain 
physical distancing guidelines. 
• Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas to 
ensure at least six feet of separation to limit transmission of the virus. 
• Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to 
maintain physical distancing protocols. 
• Close breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance between tables/chairs 
to separate workers and discourage congregating during breaks. Where 
possible, create outdoor break areas with shade covers and seating that 
ensures physical distancing. 
• Close in-store bars, bulk-bin options, and public seating areas and 
discontinue product sampling. 
• Dedicate shopping hours for vulnerable populations, including seniors and 
those medically vulnerable, preferably at a time following a complete 
cleaning. 
• Increase pickup and delivery service options for customers to help minimize 
in-store contact and maintain social distancing, such as online ordering 
and curbside pick-up. 
• Provide a single, clearly designated entrance and separate exit to help 
maintain physical distancing where possible. 
• Adjust maximum occupancy rules based on the size of the facility to limit 
the number of people in a store at one time, using no more than 50% 
maximum occupancy. 
• Be prepared to queue customers outside while still maintaining physical 
distance, including through the use of visual cues. 
• Encourage workers to practice physical distancing during pickup and 
delivery by talking with the customer through a passenger window, loading 
items directly into the customer’s trunk without contact, or leaving items at 
their door. 
• Make some locations pickup-or delivery-only to minimize worker/customer 
contact, where possible. 
• Install transfer-aiding materials, such as shelving and bulletin boards, to 
reduce person-to-person hand-offs where possible. Wherever possible, use 
contactless signatures for deliveries. 
• Expand direct store delivery window hours to spread out deliveries and 
prevent overcrowding.

comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as 
guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California 
Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers must be prepared to alter their 
operations as those guidelines change.
