OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that 
person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible, 
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not 
required) and customers/clients, 
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, 
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention 
plan. 
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new cases of 
illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and work with public 
health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for cardrooms, satellite wagering facilities, and 
racetracks with onsite wagering to support a safe, clean environment for workers. In 
addition, it provides guidance for Third-Party Providers of Proposition Player Services 
(TPPPS), who operate within the Cardrooms, where applicable. 
NOTE: Cardrooms, satellite wagering facilities, and racetracks with onsite 
wagering that operate or lease hotels, restaurants, bars, spas, salons, fitness 
centers, swimming pools, nightclubs, lounges, conventions, indoor and outdoor

sporting and entertainment venues, etc., should keep those areas closed until 
each of those types of establishments are allowed to resume modified or full 
operation. Racetracks are currently allowed to operate without spectators. When 
allowed to reopen to modified or full operation, cardrooms, satellite wagering 
facilities, and racetracks with onsite wagering with these establishments should 
refer to the appropriate industry guidance documents as they become available 
on the COVID-19 Resilience Roadmap website. All public events or concentrated 
gatherings, including musical or other performances at these facilities, must be 
cancelled or postponed. 
This guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public 
health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA 
has more comprehensive guidance on their Cal/OSHA General Guidelines on 
Protecting Workers from COVID-19 webpage. CDC has additional requirements in their 
guidance for businesses and employers. 
*Cardrooms and TPPPS should submit their workplace specific plans to the California 
Gambling Control Commission at commission@cgcc.ca.gov and the Bureau of 
Gambling Control at gamblingcontrol@doj.ca.gov prior to resuming operations. 
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly requires 
the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all public and 
workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, whether 
at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
• Interacting in-person with any member of the public; 
• Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether 
anyone from the public is present at the time; 
• Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution 
to others; 
• Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways, 
elevators, and parking facilities; 
• In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the 
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically 
distance;

•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or private
car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no
passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be found 
in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other circumstances, and 
employers can implement additional face covering requirements in fulfilling their 
obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. Employers must 
provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the reasonable cost of 
obtaining them. 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one of 
the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot wear 
one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if feasible, 
and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to wearing 
face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude any member 
of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying with the 
Guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these exemptions among 
customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Workplace Specific Plan 
•Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every
facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and
work tasks, and designate a person at each facility to implement the plan.
•Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions.
•Identify contact information for the local health department where the
facility is located, for communicating information about COVID-19
outbreaks among workers.
•Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives.
•Regularly evaluate the facility for compliance with the plan and document
and correct deficiencies identified.
•Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related factors
could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as needed to
prevent further cases.
•Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines.
•Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) and
close contacts.
•Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited.
Topics for Worker Training 
•Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to
contracting the virus.
•Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks
using CDC guidelines.
•The importance of not coming to work:
oIf a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, such
as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,

fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, 
sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, 
OR. 
oIf a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been
released from isolation, OR
oIf, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered potentially
infectious (i.e. still on isolation).
•To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 10
days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms have
improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of fever
reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without symptoms
who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only if 10 days have
passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 test.
•To  seek  medical  attention  if their  symptoms  become  severe,  including
persistent  pain  or  pressure  in  the  chest,  confusion,  or  bluish  lips  or  face.
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage.
•The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible to
unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or handwashing
station, per CDC guidelines).
•The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time (see
Physical Distancing section below).
•Proper use of face coverings, including:
oFace coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal
protective equipment (PPE).
oFace coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing.
oFace coverings must cover the nose and mouth.
oWorkers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or
adjusting face coverings.
oAvoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth.
oFace coverings must not be shared and should be washed and
discarded after each shift.

Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and 
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. 
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who 
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled. 
• Ensure independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at the 
facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and have 
necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of time with 
organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive 
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional 
information on government programs supporting sick leave and worker’s 
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under 
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and workers’ rights to workers’ 
compensation benefits and presumption of the work-relatedness of 
COVID-19 pursuant to the Governor’s Executive Order N-62-20 while that 
Order is in effect. 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers, vendors, 
contractors, and members of the public when entering the establishment. 
Make sure the temperature/symptom screener avoids close contact with 
personnel and guests to the extent possible. 
• If requiring workers to self-screen at home, which is an appropriate 
alternative to providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was 
performed prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows 
CDC guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section 
above. This self-screening does not apply to the members of the public 
who must be screened prior to entry into the facility. 
• Encourage workers and members of the public who are sick or exhibiting 
symptoms of COVID-19 to stay or return home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to 
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are 
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly 
touched items. Workers should wear gloves when handling items 
contaminated by body fluids. 
• Employers must take reasonable measures, including posting signage in

strategic and highly-visible locations, to remind the public that they must 
use face coverings and practice physical distancing, and should 
frequently wash their hands with soap for at least 20 seconds, use hand 
sanitizer, and not touch their face. Employers should take additional steps, 
for example on their website or promotional materials, to inform the public 
of these COVID-19 prevention measures prior to planning a visit. 
• Remind guests in advance to bring a face covering and make them 
available to anyone who arrives without one, if possible. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas such as lobbies, waiting 
areas, break rooms, and areas of ingress and egress including stairways, 
escalator handrails, and elevator controls. Frequently disinfect commonly 
used surfaces including counters, credit card machines, club terminals, 
touchscreens, armrests, toilets, hand washing facilities, door handles and 
locks, vehicle keys, and vehicles on display (steering wheels, door handles, 
seat adjustment controls, radio, etc.). 
• Avoid sharing phones, tablets, office equipment, or tools wherever 
possible. Never share PPE. 
• Regularly clean and disinfect equipment and furniture that must be shared 
between shifts or between users, whichever is more frequent, including but 
not limited to working surfaces, keys, chips, gaming table rails and chairs, 
dice and tiles, cards (if not discarded after use), electronic playing book 
forms, touchscreens, time clocks, cleaning equipment, and stationary and 
mobile equipment controls. 
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift. 
Cleaning tasks should be assigned during working hours as part of the 
worker’s job duties. 
• Equip terminals, desks, and help counters with proper sanitation products, 
including hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes, and provide personal hand 
sanitizers to all staff directly assisting customers. 
• Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times and 
provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when needed. 
• Provide resources to promote workers’ personal hygiene. 
• This will include tissues, no-touch trash cans, hand soap, adequate time for 
handwashing, alcohol-based hand sanitizers, disinfectants, and disposable 
towels. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use products

approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. Use 
disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, 
diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or 
alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the 
surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer’s 
directions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe 
use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should wear gloves and other 
protective equipment required by the product instructions. Follow the 
asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended by the California 
Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation. 
• To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated 
with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g., 
drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged 
facility shutdown. 
• Provide hand sanitizer dispensers (touchless wherever possible) throughout 
reception areas, lobbies, gaming tables, restaurant entrances, meeting 
and convention spaces, elevator lobbies, breakrooms, time clock 
locations, cages (both interior and exterior) showrooms, lobbies, and 
service areas, for use by customers and workers. 
• Adjust or modify table or machine operating hours to provide adequate 
time for regular thorough cleaning. 
• Install and encourage the use of credit cards and hands-free devices, if 
possible, including motion sensor lights, contactless payment systems, 
automatic soap and paper towel dispensers, and timecard systems. 
• Inspect deliveries and take all necessary and feasible disinfection measures 
when receiving goods. 
• Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that can 
disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever 
possible. 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the 
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other 
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in 
offices and other spaces.

Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between workers and customers. This can include use of physical partitions 
or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored tape, or signs to indicate where 
workers and/or customers should stand) and should be used wherever 
guests form lines or congregate including at check-stands and terminals, 
restrooms, elevator lobbies, host stands and waiting areas, valet drop off 
and pickup, etc. 
• Take measures where physical distancing cannot be maintained to 
minimize exposure between cashiers or other workers and customers, such 
as Plexiglas or other impermeable barriers. 
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., managing 
inventory rather than working as a dealer, server, cashier or managing 
administrative needs through telework). 
• Display signage at entrances, cage counters, restrooms, ATM machines, 
ticket redemption stations, gaming tables, etc. to remind customers of 
physical distancing, proper use of face coverings and the importance of 
hand hygiene at every opportunity. 
• Adjust meetings to ensure physical distance and use smaller individual 
meetings at facilities to maintain physical distancing guidelines. 
• Decrease the capacity for meeting rooms in order to maintain at least six 
feet of physical distance between workers. 
• Close breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance between tables/chairs 
to separate workers and discourage congregating during breaks. Where 
possible, create outdoor break areas with shade coverings and seating 
that ensures physical distancing. 
• Reconfigure office spaces, gaming tables, cashier’s cages, meeting rooms, 
etc. to ensure workspaces allow for six feet between workers and guests. 
• Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas like 
supply rooms, to ensure at least six feet of separation to limit transmission of 
the virus. 
• Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to 
maintain physical distancing protocols. 
• Close self-service coffee, water, and snack areas, unless guests and 
workers are capable of dispensing without physical touching.

• Provide a single, clearly designated entrance and separate exit to help 
maintain physical distancing, wherever possible. 
Additional Guidance for Interactions with 
Members of the Public 
• Place hand sanitizing stations in all high traffic areas and other areas where 
queueing and handling of chips, cards, money, tickets, etc. will occur 
including but not limited to, machine banks, gaming tables, ATM 
machines, ticket redemption machines, cashier’s cages, betting windows, 
restrooms, etc. Sanitizing stations should be monitored and maintained as 
needed. 
• When members of the public and workers pass items back and forth for an 
extended period of time (such as cards or chips), ensure frequent use of 
hand sanitizer and remind members of the public (with signs and/or 
verbally) not to touch their eyes, nose, and mouth. Consider providing 
disposable gloves at each table for use by members of the public. Provide 
a means of disposal at each location where gloves or other materials are 
provided. 
• Provide time between dealer rotations to allow for thorough hand washing. 
• For card games where players touch the cards, upon each dealer rotation, 
cards in play must be discarded, sanitized, or kept out of rotation for a 
minimum of 7 days, which is a time period sufficiently long to ensure that 
no viral contamination remains (based upon the best known information 
available). For card games where players do not touch the cards, after a 
period of no more than 8 hours, cards in play must be discarded, 
disinfected, sanitized, or kept out of rotation for at minimum 7 days. The 
dealer must use hand sanitizer prior to beginning play at each card table 
and immediately at the conclusion of the table rotation. 
• All chips should be washed and disinfected prior to circulation. Chips 
should be removed from service and replaced with clean chips upon 
every dealer rotation. 
• Remove tables, chairs, machines, gaming tables, etc. from guest areas so 
that six feet of physical distance can be maintained for customers and 
workers wherever possible. If such items cannot be moved, use visual cues 
to show that they are not available for use or install Plexiglas or other types 
of impermeable physical barriers to minimize exposure between customers. 
• Reduce the number of occupants at gaming tables so that guests have 
increased physical distance. Install impermeable barriers if feasible. 
Discontinue non-player game watching that increases the chance of 
guests breaking physical distance of six feet. 
11
----------------Page (10) Break----------------
• Discontinue meal service at gaming tables. Staff should take and deliver 
drink orders to customers to limit the number of people moving around 
shared spaces. When serving drinks at tables with guests from different 
households, providing beverages in disposable, lidded containers is 
recommended. 
• For racetracks and satellite wagering facilities with betting windows, 
closure of betting windows to allow six feet of separation is highly 
recommended. Consider opening additional locations in alternative 
venues to increase physical distancing and including physical 
impermeable barriers, where possible. Provide sanitation stations at the 
alternative venues. 
• Racetrack and satellite wagering facilities seating areas should be 
reconfigured and sectional closures implemented based on physical 
distancing requirements including the installation of barriers where 
necessary. 
• Provide resources to promote personal hygiene of members of the public. 
This will include tissues, no-touch trash cans, hand soap, adequate 
locations for handwashing, alcohol-based hand sanitizers, disinfectants, 
and disposable towels. 
1 Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Employers must 
comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as 
guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California 
Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers must be prepared to alter their 
operations as those guidelines change.
