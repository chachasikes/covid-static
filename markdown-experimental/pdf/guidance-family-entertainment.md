INDUSTRY 
GUIDANCE: 
Family Entertainment 
Centers 
July 29, 2020 
All guidance should be implemented 
only with county health officer approval 
following their review of local 
epidemiological data including cases 
per 100,000 population, rate of test 
positivity, and local preparedness to 
support a health care surge, vulnerable 
populations, contact tracing, and 
testing. 1

OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at 
home to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that 
may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with 
serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are 
at higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely 
when people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected 
person, even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed 
symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available 
at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating 
that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of 
these workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken 
to ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible, 
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not 
required) and customers/clients, 
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, 
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention 
plan. 
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify 
new cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene 
quickly and work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for family entertainment center operators to 
support a safe, clean environment for workers and customers. Examples of such 
businesses include bowling alleys, miniature golf, batting cages, arcades, and movie 
theaters. 
NOTE: This guidance is not intended for ice rinks, roller rinks, laser tag arenas, 
etc., where guests are less able to maintain physical distancing of at least six

feet, where a central part of the activity is circulating in the space, and which 
can accommodate a large number of guests who are mainly from different 
households. It is not intended for amusement, theme, or water parks; however, 
these types of parks that have stand-alone bowling alleys, miniature golf, 
arcades, movie theaters, etc., may open those operations provided they 
adhere to applicable state and local guidance and keep other attractions 
closed including amusement park rides. Discontinue demonstrations, such as 
magic, live animal shows etc., unless physical distancing and sanitation 
protocols can be met. Family entertainment centers with convention space, 
rentable meeting rooms, other areas for private events such as birthday 
parties, etc., should keep those areas closed until such activities are allowed to 
resume modified or full operation through a specific reopening order and 
guidance. Family entertainment centers with restaurants, bars, coffee shops, 
gift shops, museums and interactive exhibits, etc., should refer to guidance on 
such industries as it becomes available on the COVID-19 Resilience Roadmap 
website. 
Even with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a setting bringing 
multiple different households to engage in the same activity carries a 
relatively higher risk for widespread transmission of the COVID-19 virus, and 
may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, 
especially among more vulnerable populations. 
*Movie theaters must therefore limit attendance to 25% of theater capacity or 
a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower. The California Department 
of Public Health, in consultation with county Departments of Public Health, will 
review and assess the impact of these imposed limits on public health and 
provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of leisure activities. 
This guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to 
public health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. 
Cal/OSHA has more comprehensive guidance on their Cal/OSHA General Guidelines 
on Protecting Workers from COVID-19 webpage. CDC has additional requirements in 
their guidance for businesses and employers. 
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure.

People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or
distribution to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance;
•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When
no passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering requirements 
in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. 
Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the 
reasonable cost of obtaining them. 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one of 
the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot 
wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if 
feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude 
any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying 
with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these 
exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Workplace Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every 
facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and 
work tasks, and designate a person at each facility to implement the 
plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
facility is located, for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the facility for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related factors 
could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as needed to 
prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has 
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) and 
close contacts. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
Topics for Worker Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to 
contracting the virus. 
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks 
using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work: 
o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, such

as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, 
fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, 
sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, 
OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR 
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone 
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered 
potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 10 
days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms have 
improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of fever 
reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without symptoms 
who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only if 10 days 
have passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 test. 
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including 
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible 
to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or 
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time 
(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not 
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or 
discarded after each shift. 
• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face

Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and 
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. 
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who 
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled. 
• Ensure any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at 
the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and 
have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of 
time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive 
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional 
information on government programs supporting sick leave and worker’s 
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under 
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the Governor’s Executive 
Order N-51-20, and workers’ rights to workers’ compensation benefits and 
presumption of the work-relatedness of COVID-19 pursuant to the 
Governor’s Executive order N-62-20 while that Order is in effect. 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers 
entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom 
screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible. 
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to 
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed 
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC 
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. 
• Encourage workers and visitors who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of 
COVID-19 to stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to 
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are 
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly 
touched items. Workers should wear gloves when handling items 
contaminated by body fluids. 
• Employers must take reasonable measures, including posting signage in 
strategic and highly-visible locations and in reservation confirmations, to 
remind the public that they must use face coverings and practice 
physical distancing, and should frequently wash their hands with soap for 
7

at least 20 seconds, use hand sanitizer, and not touch their face. 
• Remind guests in advance to bring a face covering and make them 
available to anyone who arrives without one, if possible. 
• Guests and visitors should be temperature and/or symptom screened 
upon arrival, asked to use hand sanitizer, and to bring and wear a face 
covering when not eating or drinking. 
• Display a set of clearly visible rules for customers and personnel at 
entrance(s) that are to be a condition of entry. The rules could include 
instructions to use hand sanitizer, maintain physical distance from other 
customers, avoid unnecessary touching of surfaces, contact information 
for the local health department, and changes to services. Whenever 
possible, the rules should be available digitally, include pictograms, etc. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas such as customer waiting 
areas and lobbies, worker break rooms, etc., and areas of ingress and 
egress, including stairways and elevator banks. Frequently disinfect 
commonly used surfaces, including counters, credit card machines, 
touchscreens, buttons, doorknobs, armrests, toilets, hand washing 
facilities, coin-operated and redemption games, vending machines, etc. 
• Disinfect rented or shared items before issuing to and when returning from 
customer use, including bowling balls, golf balls, putters, writing 
implements, bats, shoes, helmets, etc. Close self-service item selection 
areas for games or activities, such as bowling balls on accessible racks, 
and provide these items to customers individually. 
• Provide hand sanitizer dispensers throughout activity areas, lobbies, and 
service areas, for use by customers and workers. Hand sanitizer should be 
available for customers to use when activity items come into contact with 
shared surfaces (e.g., golf balls and golf cups, bowling balls and return 
machinery, etc.). Encourage guests to wash hands and/or use hand 
sanitizer often while using equipment and items. Remind members of the 
public (with signs and/or verbally) not to touch their eyes, nose, and 
mouth. Consider providing disposable gloves at each activity area for use 
by members of the public. Make available a means of disposal at each 
location where gloves are provided. 
• Provide disposable or single-use items whenever possible. This could 
include scorecards, pencils, 3D glasses, etc. If disposable replacements 
cannot be provided, properly disinfect items before and after customer 
use. 
• Thoroughly clean and disinfect each customer activity area after every

use. This can include disinfecting tables, chairs, booster seats, booths, 
touch screens, etc. Allow adequate time for proper disinfection, following 
product instructions. Environmental Protection Agency-approved 
disinfectants require a minimum contact time (seconds to minutes) to be 
effective against human coronavirus. 
• Regularly clean and disinfect surfaces shared by workers between shifts or 
between users, whichever is more frequent, including but not limited to 
working surfaces, time clocks, copy machines, keys, cleaning equipment, 
gaming machinery, etc. Avoid sharing equipment such as phones, 
tablets, office machinery, and tools wherever possible. Never share PPE. 
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift. 
Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as part of 
the employee’s job duties. 
• Equip terminals, desks, and help counters with proper sanitation products, 
including hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes, and provide personal 
hand sanitizers to all staff directly assisting customers. 
• Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times and 
provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when needed. 
• Provide resources to promote employees’ personal hygiene. This will 
include tissues, no-touch trash cans, hand soap, adequate time for 
handwashing, alcohol-based hand sanitizers, disinfectant wipes, and disposable 
towels. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use products 
approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. Use 
disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, 
diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or 
alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the 
surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer’s 
directions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe 
use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should wear gloves and other 
protective equipment as required by the product instructions. Follow the 
asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended by the California 
Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation. 
• To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases 
associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and 
features (e.g., drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use 
after a prolonged facility shutdown. 
• Adjust or modify facility hours to provide adequate time for regular 
thorough cleaning. 
• Install and encourage the use of credit cards and hands-free devices, if

possible, including motion sensor lights, contactless payment systems, 
automatic soap and paper towel dispensers, and timecard systems. 
• Inspect deliveries and take all necessary and feasible disinfection 
measures when receiving goods. 
• Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that 
can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter 
wherever possible. 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the 
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other 
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in 
offices and other spaces. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Adjust maximum occupancy rules to limit the number of people at family 
entertainment centers as appropriate to support physical distancing. 
• Limit customer groups to a household unit. People from the same 
household do not need to be six feet apart. 
• Close ball pits, foam pits, indoor playgrounds, climbing structures, 
enclosed bounce houses, etc., in accordance with CDC guidelines, as 
these areas promote congregation and are difficult to properly disinfect 
between uses. 
• Family entertainment centers with prize redemption counters, gift shops, 
etc., should refer to and follow the guidelines for retail available on the 
COVID-19 webpage. 
• Family entertainment centers that offer food and drink concessions should 
encourage customers to order online or over the phone, whenever 
possible, and make items available for counter pick-up. Use visual cues to 
ensure customers maintain physical distances of at least six feet while 
waiting in line. Install impermeable barriers at concession counters, if 
possible. 
• Install physical, impermeable barriers or partitions between game, 
seating, and other types of activity areas to minimize exposure between 
customers. If this is not possible, discontinue activity areas from use (using 
visual cues, removing items, etc.) so that customers can maintain at least 
six feet of distance at all times. Employers should take into consideration 
whether an activity may cause a customer to require additional space 
and make modifications to ensure adequate physical distances. 
• Implement timed and/or advanced reservation ticketing systems and

pre-assigned seating or activity areas, whenever possible, to stagger 
customer visits and help maintain physical distances. Ask visitors to waitin 
their vehicle until their reservation time and to arrive and leave in a single 
group to minimize crossflow of visitors and staff. 
• Dedicate staff to manage movement of customers when activities could 
bring people within six feet of distance from each other, such as ushering 
customers to seats, preventing congregation in bottleneck areas, limiting 
groups from playing through courses, etc. 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between people, such as when customers are waiting in line. This can 
include use of physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings or 
signs to indicate to where workers and customers/visitors should stand). 
• Install impermeable barriers where physical distancing cannot be 
maintained to minimize exposure between workers and customers. 
• All workers should minimize the amount of time spent within six feet of 
guests. 
• Designate separate routes for entry and exit into facilities, activity areas, 
seating areas, work areas, etc., if possible, to help maintain physical 
distancing and lessen the instances of people closely passing each other. 
Establish one-way directional hallways and passageways for foot traffic, if 
possible, to eliminate workers and guests from passing by one another. 
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., managing 
inventory rather than working as a cashier or managing administrative 
needs through telework). 
• Reconfigure workspaces, if possible, to allow for six feet between workers. 
Hold smaller meetings at facilities to maintain physical distancing 
guidelines and consider holding meetings outside or via online platforms 
or telephone. 
• Close or limit access to breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance 
between tables/chairs to separate workers and discourage congregating 
during breaks. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade 
coverings and seating arrangements that ensures physical distancing. 
• Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas, 
such as supply rooms and counter areas, to ensure at least six feet of 
separation to limit transmission of the virus. 
• Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to 
maintain physical distancing protocols. 
• Redesign parking lots to limit congregation points and ensure proper

separation (e.g., every other space, contactless payment, etc.) 
Additional Considerations for Indoor Movie 
Theaters 
• Limit the number of attendees in each theater to 25% of theater capacity 
or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower. 
• Implement a reservation system to limit the number of attendees entering 
the theater at a time whenever possible. Designate arrival times as part of 
reservations, if possible, so that customers arrive at and enter the theater 
in staggered groups. 
• Establish directional entry and exit into theaters where possible. 
• Reconfigure, close, or otherwise remove seats from use to ensure physical 
distancing of at least six feet between attendees. This may require seating 
every other row or blocking off or removing seats in a “checkerboard” style 
(use each row but make sure no one is directly behind other patrons) so that 
distances are maintained in all directions. Members of the same household may 
be seated together but should maintain at least six feet of distance from other 
households. 
• Dedicate staff to help people maintain distances before and after 
screenings. This could include ushering to seats prior to the start of a show 
and dismissing customers in an orderly fashion to reduce the crossflow of 
traffic or crowding in exit rows. 
• Consider using disposable or washable seat covers in theaters, particularly 
on porous surfaces that are difficult to properly clean. Discard and 
replace seat covers between each use. 
• Prop or hold doors open during peak periods when attendees are 
entering and exiting facilities, if possible and in accordance with security 
and safety protocols. 
• Consider limiting the number of people that use the restroom at one time 
to allow for physical distancing. 
• Reconfigure parking lots to limit congregation points and ensure proper 
separation (e.g., closing every other space).
