OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at 
home to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that 
may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with 
serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are 
at higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely 
when people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected 
person, even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed 
symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available 
at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating 
that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of 
these workplaces include places of worship, hospitals, long-term care facilities, 
prisons, food production, warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken 
to ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible, 
✓use of face coverings by workers and volunteers (where respiratory protection 
is not required) and congregants/visitors, 
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, 
✓training workers and volunteers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 
prevention plan. 
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for places of worship and providers of religious 
services and cultural ceremonies (referred to collectively as “places of worship”) 
to support a safe, clean environment for workers, interns and trainees, volunteers, 
scholars, and all other types of workers as well as congregants, worshippers, 
visitors, etc. (referred to collectively as “visitors” or “congregants”). This guidance 
does not obligate places of worship to resume in-person activity. Further, it is 
strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote

services and other related activities for those who are vulnerable to COVID-19 
including older adults and those with co-morbidities. 
Even with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational setting 
of multiple different households to practice a personal faith carries a relatively higher 
risk for widespread transmission of the COVID-19 virus, and may result in increased 
rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable 
populations. In particular, activities such as singing and chanting negate the risk-
reduction achieved through six feet of physical distancing. 
*Places of worship must therefore discontinue indoor singing and chanting activities 
and limit indoor attendance to 25% of building capacity or a maximum of 100 
attendees, whichever is lower. Local Health Officers are advised to consider 
appropriate limitations on outdoor attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction's 
key COVID-19 health indicators. At a minimum, outdoor attendance should be limited 
naturally through implementation of strict physical distancing measures of a minimum 
of six feet between attendees from different households, in addition to other relevant 
protocols within this document.
This revised limitation will be subject to regular review by the California Department 
of Public Health in consultation with local Departments of Public Health to assess the 
impact of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as 
part of a phased-in restoration of activities in places of worship. 
NOTE: This guidance is not intended for food preparation and service, delivery 
of items to those in need, childcare and daycare services, school and 
educational activities, in-home caregiving, counseling, office work, and other 
activities that places and organizations of worship may provide. Organizations 
that perform these activities must follow applicable guidance on the COVID-19 
Resilience Roadmap website. 
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to
public health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. 
Cal/OSHA has more safety and health guidance on their Cal/OSHA Guidance on 
Requirements to Protect Workers from Coronavirus webpage. The CDC has additional 
guidance for community-and faith-based organizations. 
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work,

whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or
distribution to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance;
•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When
no passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering 
requirements in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful 
workplace. Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers 
for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one 
of the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot 
wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if 
feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude 
any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying 
with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these 
exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Workplace Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every 
location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and 
all work tasks, and designate a person at each workplace to implement 
the plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
workplace is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers and congregants/visitors. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate workplaces for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as 
needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace 
has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive workers 
and close contacts. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
Topics for Worker and Volunteer Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible 
to contracting the virus. 
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks 
using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work or participating in activities 
o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC,

such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty 
breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of 
taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea, OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR 
o If within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone 
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered 
potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 10 
days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms have 
improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of fever 
reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without symptoms 
who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only if 10 days 
have passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 test. 
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including 
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 
60% ethanol or 70% isopropanol when workers cannot get to a sink or 
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time 
(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not 
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or 
discarded after each shift. 
• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face

Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face 
coverings must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, 
work rules, and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the 
use of face coverings. Training should also include the employer’s 
policies on how people who are exempted from wearing a face 
covering will be handled. 
• Ensure all types of workers including temporary, independent 
contractors, and volunteer workers are also properly trained in 
COVID-19 prevention policies and have necessary PPE. Discuss these 
responsibilities ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary, 
contract, and/or volunteer staff. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to 
receive that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See 
additional information on government programs supporting sick leave 
and worker’s compensation for COVID-19, including worker’s sick 
leave rights under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and 
worker’s rights to workers’ compensation benefits and presumption of 
the work-relatedness of COVID-19 pursuant to the 
Governor’s Executive Order N-62-20 while that Order is in effect. 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift. Make sure the temperature/symptom screener 
avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible. 
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to 
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed 
prior to the worker and/or volunteer leaving the home for their shift and 
follows CDC guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training 
section above. 
• Encourage workers and congregants/visitors who are sick or exhibiting 
symptoms of COVID-19, or who have family members who are ill, to 
stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers and volunteers use all 
required protective equipment, including eye protection and gloves, 
where necessary. 
• Places of worship should consider where disposable gloves use may be 
helpful to supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; 
examples are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or 
handling commonly touched items. All workers and volunteers should 
wear gloves when handling items contaminated by body fluids.

• Workers, volunteers, etc., should not enter the home or visit someone 
who has tested positive for, exhibited symptoms of, or has been in 
contact with someone infected with COVID-19 for an appropriate 
waiting period as described by CDC guidelines. 
• Places of worship must take reasonable measures, including posting 
signage in strategic and highly-visible locations and in reservation 
confirmations, to remind congregants and visitors that they must use face 
coverings and practice physical distancing and should frequently wash 
their hands with soap for at least 20 seconds, use hand sanitizer, and not 
touch their face. 
• Use social media, website, texts, email, newsletters, etc., to communicate 
the steps being taken to protect congregants/visitors and workers so that 
they are familiar with the policies (including to stay home if experiencing 
symptoms or are at increased risk of becoming sick, face coverings, 
physical distancing, handwashing and/or sanitizing, and cough 
etiquette), before arriving at the facility. Workers and volunteers are 
strongly encouraged to remind congregants/visitors of these practices 
with announcements during services or on welcoming guests. 
• Remind congregants and visitors in advance to bring a face 
covering and make them available to anyone who arrives without 
one, if possible. 
• Congregants/visitors should be screened for temperature and/or 
symptoms upon arrival to places of worship and asked to use hand 
sanitizer. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Perform thorough cleaning of high traffic areas such as lobbies, halls, 
chapels, meeting rooms, offices, libraries, and study areas and areas of 
ingress and egress including stairways, stairwells, handrails, and elevator 
controls. Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces including 
doorknobs, toilets, handwashing facilities, pulpits and podiums, 
donation boxes or plates, altars, and pews and seating areas. 
• Establish frequent cleaning and disinfection of personal work areas such 
as desks and cubicles and supply the necessary cleaning products. 
Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their 
shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as 
part of the workers’ job duties. 
• Discourage sharing items used in worship and services (such as prayer 
books, cushions, prayer rugs, etc.) whenever possible and provide single-
use or digital copies or ask congregants/visitors to bring personal items

instead. Avoid sharing work equipment and supplies, such as phones, 
office equipment, computers, etc., wherever possible. Never share PPE. 
• Where such items must be shared, disinfect between shifts or uses, 
whichever is more frequent, including the following: shared office 
equipment (copiers, fax machines, printers, telephones, keyboards, 
staplers, etc.) and shared worship items, etc., with a cleaner 
appropriate for the surface. 
• Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times 
and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when 
needed. Consider more frequently cleaning and disinfecting 
handwashing facilities that are used more often. Use signage to 
reinforce handwashing. 
• Disinfect microphones and stands, music stands, instruments and other 
items on pulpits and podiums between each use. Consult equipment 
manufacturers to determine appropriate disinfection steps, 
particularly for soft, porous surfaces such as foam mufflers. 
• Consider using disposable seat covers for congregants/visitors, 
particularly on porous surfaces or where a facility has multiple daily 
services. Discard and replace seat covers between each use. Provide 
disposable or washable covers on pillows used as seating on floors and 
change/wash them after each use. 
• Install hand sanitizer dispensers, touchless whenever possible, at 
entrances and contact areas such as meeting rooms, lobbies, 
and elevator landings. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, establishments should use 
products approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. 
Use disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral 
pathogens, diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon 
of water),or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are 
appropriate for the surface. Provide workers training on the chemical 
hazards, manufacturer’s directions, ventilation requirements, and 
Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers and volunteers using 
cleaners or disinfectants should wear gloves or other protective 
equipment as required by the product instructions. Follow the asthma-
safer cleaning methods recommended by the California Department of 
Public Health and ensure proper ventilation. 
• Wash religious garments and linens after each service or event, at the 
highest water setting possible. Ask congregants/visitors to bring their 
own storage bags for personal garments and shoes. Workers, 
congregants, and visitors should wear gloves when handling others’ 
dirty linens, shoes, etc.

• Discontinue passing offering plates and similar items that move between 
people. Use alternative giving options such as secure drop boxes that do 
not require opening/closing and can be cleaned and disinfected. 
Consider implementing digital systems that allow congregants/visitors to 
make touch-free offerings. 
• Mark walking paths between spaces designated for congregants/visitors 
to sit/kneel so that people do not walk where someone may touch their 
head to the floor. 
• During meetings and services, introduce fresh outside air, for example by 
opening doors/windows (weather permitting) and operating ventilation 
systems. 
• Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods 
that can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA 
filter wherever possible. 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the 
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making 
other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and 
ventilation in worship areas, offices, and other spaces. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Places of worship should continue to provide services through alternative 
methods (such as via internet live and/or recorded streaming, telephone, 
drive-in, etc.) whenever possible. 
• Consider holding in-person meetings and providing in-person services 
outside whenever possible. 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between workers and congregants/visitors, etc. This can include use of 
physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor or pew markings or signs to 
indicate where people should sit and stand). Reconfigure seating and 
standing areas to maintain physical distancing of six feet or more 
between congregants/visitors from different households. Consider 
limiting seating to alternate rows. Members of the same household may 
be seated together but should maintain at least six feet of distance from 
other households. 
• Consider dedicating workers to help people maintain distances 
during activities. 
• Shorten services to limit the length of time congregants/visitors spend at 
facilities whenever possible. This could include limiting speeches, asking 
congregants/visitors to put on garments at home before arrival, etc.

• Close places of worship for visitation outside of scheduled services, 
meetings, etc., whenever possible. 
• Consider implementing a reservation system to limit the number of 
congregants/visitors attending facilities at a time. This can include the 
use of digital platforms or other types of tools. 
• Encourage congregants/visitors to meet with the same group, particularly 
when services meet frequently and/or require a certain number of 
people to be present. This can reduce the spread of transmission by 
minimizing the number of different individuals who come into close 
contact with each other. 
• Consider offering additional meeting times (per day or per week) so that 
fewer guests attend meetings and services at one time. Clean meeting 
areas between each use as described in this guidance. 
• Discontinue large gatherings that encourage congregants/visitors to 
travel and break physical distances during activities, such as concerts, 
large holiday and life event celebrations and remembrances. 
• Children should remain in the care of those in their household unit and 
not interact with children of other parties at any time while visiting 
facilities. Close play areas and discontinue activities and services for 
children where physical distancing of at least six feet cannot be 
maintained. 
• Encourage congregants/visitors to physically distance themselves from 
others outside their household, avoid touching surfaces, and to leave the 
facility if they do not feel well. 
• Consider limiting touching for religious and/or cultural purposes, such as 
holding hands, to members of the same household. 
• Dedicate workers to direct guests to meeting rooms upon entry to 
places of worship rather than congregating in lobbies or common 
areas. Consider using ushers to help people find places to sit and stand 
that are at least six feet apart from other guests/household groups. Ask 
congregants/visitors to arrive and leave in a single group to minimize 
crossflow of people. Welcome and dismiss congregants/visitors from 
altars, podiums, meeting rooms, etc. in an orderly way to maintain 
physical distancing and minimize crossflow of traffic, to the extent 
possible. 
• Prop or hold doors open during peak periods when congregants/visitors 
are entering and exiting facilities, if possible and in accordance with 
security and safety protocols. 
• Close or restrict common areas, such as break rooms, kitchenettes, foyers, 
11

etc. where people are likely to congregate and interact. Consider 
installing barriers or increase physical distance between tables/seating 
when there is continued use of these areas. 
• Remove from service or find low-community touch alternatives for 
communal/religious water containers such as fonts, sinks, and vessels. 
Empty and change water between uses. Where there is a possibility of 
contaminant splash, workers, congregants, visitors, etc., are strongly 
encouraged to use equipment to protect the eyes, nose, and mouth 
using a combination of face coverings, protective glasses, and/or face 
shields. Reusable protective equipment such as shields and glasses 
should be properly disinfected between uses. 
• When washing is a required activity, modify practices whenever possible 
to limit splashing and the need to clean and disinfect washing facilities. 
Encourage necessary washing to be performed at home prior to 
entering a facility, if possible. 
• Reconfigure podiums and speaker areas, office spaces, meeting rooms, 
conference rooms, etc., to allow for at least six feet between people. 
• Establish directional hallways and passageways for foot traffic, ifpossible, 
and designate separate routes for entry and exit into meeting rooms, 
offices, etc., to help maintain physical distancing and lessen the 
instances of people closely passing each other. 
• Limit the number of individuals riding in an elevator at a time. Post 
signage regarding these policies. 
• Utilize practices, when feasible and necessary, to limit the number of 
workers and congregants/visitors in office, meeting spaces, etc., at one 
time. This may include scheduling (e.g. staggering start/end times), 
establishing alternating days for onsite reporting, returning to places of 
worship in phases, or continued use of telework when feasible. 
• Consider offering workers and volunteers who request modified duties 
options that minimize their contact with congregants/visitors and 
other workers (e.g., office duties rather than working as an usher or 
managing administrative needs through telework). 
• Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, 
to maintain physical distancing protocols. 
• Discontinue nonessential travel and encourage distance meetings via 
phone and internet. 
• Close self-service item selection such as pamphlet displays and 
bookshelves and provide these items to congregants/visitors individually 
as necessary. Consider delivering items and information electronically.

• Consider limiting the number of people that use the restroom at one time 
to allow for physical distancing. 
• Discourage workers, congregants, visitors, etc., from engaging in 
handshakes, hugs, and similar greetings that break physical distance. 
Take reasonable measures to remind people to wave or use other 
greetings. 
• Reconfigure parking lots to limit congregation points and ensure proper 
separation (e.g., closing every other space). If performing drive-in 
services, ensure vehicle windows and doors are closed if six feet of 
distance is not possible between vehicles. 
• Continue to support non-in person attendance of services and other 
related activities by those who are vulnerable to COVID-19 including 
older adults and those with co-morbidities. 
Considerations for Places of Worship 
• Discontinue offering self-service food and beverages. Do not hold 
potlucks or similar family-style eating and drinking events that increase 
the risk of cross contamination. If food and beverages must be served, 
provide items in single-serve, disposable containers whenever possible. 
Workers or volunteers serving food should wash hands frequently and 
wear disposable gloves. 
• Discontinue singing (in rehearsals, services, etc.), chanting, and other 
practices and performances where there is increased likelihood for 
transmission from contaminated exhaled droplets. Consider practicing 
these activities through alternative methods (such as internet streaming) 
that ensure individual congregation members perform these activities 
separately in their own homes. 
• Consider modifying practices that are specific to particular faith traditions 
that might encourage the spread of COVID-19. Examples are 
discontinuing kissing of ritual objects, allowing rites to be performed by 
fewer people, avoiding the use of a common cup, offering communion 
in the hand instead of on the tongue, providing pre-packed communion 
items on chairs prior to service, etc., in accordance with CDC guidelines.

Considerations for Funerals 
• Consider reduced visitor capacity and stagger visitation times at funerals, 
wakes, etc., if possible. Follow all cleaning and disinfection measures as 
described in this guidance. Whenever possible, remind visitors to maintain 
physical distance from each other, from workers and volunteers, and 
from the deceased. 
• Consider modifying religious or cultural practices when washing or 
shrouding bodies of those who have died from COVID-19, in 
accordance with guidance from CDPH and the CDC. If washing the 
body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, work 
with funeral home staff and families to reduce exposure as much as 
possible. All people participating in these activities must wear 
disposable gloves and if there will be splashing of fluids, people must 
use additional protective equipment including protection for the eyes, 
nose, and mouth, such as face shields. 
• Consult and comply with local guidance regarding limits on gathering 
sizes, travel, holding funerals for those who died from COVID-19, etc. 
• Consider other recommendations and modifications of services related 
to places of worship outlined above, as applicable for funeral services. 
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Places of worship must 
comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as 
guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California 
Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, places of worship must be prepared to alter 
their operations as those guidelines change.
