 Frequent handwashing and use of hand sanitizer. 
 Provide and ensure workers use all necessary PPE. 
 Provide disposable gloves to workers as a supplement to frequent hand washing 
for other cleaning, task such as handling commonly touched items, or 
conducting symptom screening.  
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
 Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas.  
 Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces. 
 Clean and sanitize shared equipment between each use. 
 Clean touchable working surfaces between shifts or between users, whichever is 
more frequent. 
 Ensure delivery vehicles, vehicle cabs, and equipment are cleaned before and 
after delivery routes and carry additional disinfection materials during deliveries. 
 Avoid sharing phones, other work tools, or equipment wherever possible. 
 Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times.  
 Stagger breaks if feasible to ensure physical distancing. 
 Clean restrooms frequently.  
 Use products approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and train workers on chemical hazards, product 
instructions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements. Follow CDPH 
asthma-safer cleaning methods. 
 Continue to follow existing codes regarding requirements for sanitizing (rather 
than disinfecting) food contact surfaces. 
 Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices before, during, and 
after shifts; consider hiring third-party cleaning companies. 
 Inspect deliveries and take all necessary and feasible disinfection measures when 
receiving goods that appear tampered with. 
 Consider upgrades to improve air filtration and ventilation.

Physical Distancing Guidelines 
 Implement measures to physically separate workers by at least six feet using 
measures such as physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored 
tape, or signs to indicate to where workers should stand). 
 Minimize exposure between workers where physical distancing cannot be 
maintained, using barrier such as Plexiglas. 
 Adjust safety meetings to ensure physical distancing and use smaller individual 
safety meetings at the workplace to maintain physical distancing. 
 Utilize work practices if needed and feasible to limit the number of workers and 
maintain physical distancing. 
 Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to 
maintain physical distancing protocols.  
 Consider providing individual water bottles instead of water containers and cups. 
 Use the following hierarchy to prevent transmission of COVID-19 in work areas 
especially where physical distancing is difficult to maintain: engineering controls, 
administrative controls, and PPE. 
 Designate drop-off locations to receive deliveries away from on-farm high traffic 
areas.
