COVID-19 
INDUSTRY 
GUIDANCE: 
Museums, Galleries, 
Zoos, and Aquariums 
July 29, 2020 
All guidance should be implemented 
only with county health officer approval 
following their review of local 
epidemiological data including cases 
per 100,000 population, rate of test 
positivity, and local preparedness to 
support a health care surge, vulnerable 
populations, contact tracing, and 
testing. 1

OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at 
home to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that 
may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with 
serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are 
at higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely 
when people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected 
person, even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed 
symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available 
at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating 
that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of 
these workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken 
to ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not required)
and guests/clients/visitors,
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for museums, galleries, botanical gardens, zoos, 
aquariums, and other similar spaces (referred to collectively as “museums”) to support 
a safe, clean environment for workers.  
NOTE: This guidance is not intended for amusement, theme, or water parks. 
Museums with convention space, rentable meeting rooms, other areas for 
private events, etc., should keep those areas closed until large gatherings are 
allowed to resume modified or full operation through a specific reopening 
order and guidance. Museums with family entertainment activities (including 
2
----------------Page (1) Break----------------
movie theaters), restaurants (including concessions, cafes, etc.), retail gift 
shops, life science research labs, etc., should refer to guidance on such 
industries as it becomes available on the COVID-19 Resilience Roadmap 
website. Discontinue demonstrations, such as live animal shows, unless 
physical distancing and sanitation protocols can be ensured. All large events 
or gatherings, such as concerts or private parties/events, must be cancelled or 
postponed. 
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to
public health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. 
Cal/OSHA has more comprehensive guidance on their Cal/OSHA General Guidelines 
on Protecting Workers from COVID-19 webpage. CDC has additional requirements in 
their guidance for businesses and employers. 
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure.  
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution
to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance;
•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no
passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering requirements 
in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. 
3
----------------Page (2) Break----------------
Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the 
reasonable cost of obtaining them.  Employers should develop an accommodation 
policy for any worker who meets one of the exemptions from wearing a face covering. 
If a worker who would otherwise be required to wear a face covering because of 
frequent contact with others cannot wear one due to a medical condition, they 
should be provided with a non-restrictive alternative, such as a face shield with a 
drape attached to the bottom edge, if feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude 
any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying 
with the Guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handing these 
exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Workplace Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every 
location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and 
work tasks, and designate a person at each location to implement the 
plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions.  
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
operation is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the location for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related factors 
could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as needed to 
prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has 
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) and 
close contacts. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
 
Topics for Worker and Volunteer Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to 
contracting the virus. Establishments that keep animals should provide 
information on how to prevent the spread of COVID-19 between 
people and animals, as it becomes available. 
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom 
checks, using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work if: 
o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, such 
5
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
 
as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, 
fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, 
sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, 
OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR 
o If, within the past14 days, a worker has had contact with someone 
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered potentially 
infectious (i.e. still on isolation).  
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 10 
days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms have 
improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of fever 
reducing medications) for the last 72 hours.  A worker without symptoms 
who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only if 10 days 
have passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 test, 
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including 
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible 
to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or 
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time 
(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not 
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or 
discarded after each shift. 
• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
6
----------------Page (5) Break----------------
 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and 
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. 
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who 
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled. 
• Ensure independent contractors, temporary, volunteer, and all other 
types of workers at the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 
prevention policies and have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these 
responsibilities ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary 
and/or contract workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive 
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional 
information on government  programs supporting sick leave and worker’s 
compensation for COVID- 19, including worker’s sick leave rights under 
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and worker’s rights to workers’ 
compensation benefits and presumption of the work-relatedness of 
COVID-19 pursuant to the Governor’s Executive Order N-62-20 while that 
Order is in effect. 
 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers (including 
docents, interns, volunteers, etc.) at the beginning of their shift. Make sure 
the temperature/symptom screener avoids close contact with workers to 
the extent possible.  
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to 
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed 
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC 
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. 
• Encourage workers, volunteers, and visitors who are sick or exhibiting 
symptoms of COVID-19 to stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers and volunteers use all 
required protective equipment, including eye protection and gloves 
where necessary. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to 
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are 
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly 
touched items. Workers should wear gloves when handling items 
contaminated by body fluids. 
• Museums must take reasonable measures, including posting signage at 
entrances, in strategic and highly-visible locations, and in reservation 
7
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
 
confirmations, to remind the public that they must use face coverings and 
practice physical distancing, and that they should frequently wash their 
hands with soap for at least 20 seconds, use hand sanitizer, and not touch 
their face. 
• Remind guests in advance to bring a face covering and make them 
available to anyone who arrives without one, if possible.  
• Guests and visitors should be temperature and/or symptom screened 
upon arrival, asked to use hand sanitizer, and to wear a face covering. 
Face coverings should be provided to guests who arrive without them.  
• Display a set of clearly visible rules for guests at entrance(s) that are to be 
a condition of entry. The rules could include instructions to use hand 
sanitizer, wear face coverings during the visit, maintain physical distance 
from workers and other guests/groups, avoid unnecessary touching of 
surfaces, contact information for the local health department, and 
changes to services. Whenever possible, the rules should be available 
digitally and include pictograms. 
 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Frequently clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces such as grab 
bars, railings, placards, interactive exhibits, light switches, door handles, 
etc. Operators should identify and disinfect surfaces that children are 
more likely to touch, such as sections of windows and fence posts closer 
to the ground. 
• Encourage the use of credit cards and contactless payment systems.  
• Perform thorough cleaning of any outdoor and indoor areas that workers 
or the public are likely to use or occupy. This should include high traffic 
areas and shared workspaces (offices, meeting rooms, break rooms, etc.), 
and areas of ingress and egress (handrails, stairways, elevator controls, 
etc.) 
• Avoid sharing phones, tablets, two-way radios, other work supplies, or 
office equipment wherever possible. Never share PPE. 
• Where such items must be shared, disinfect with a cleaner appropriate for 
the surface between shifts or uses, whichever is more frequent, including 
the following: shared office equipment, such as copiers, fax machines, 
printers, telephones, keyboards, terminals, ATM PIN pads, staplers, staple 
removers, surfaces in reception areas, shared work stations, audio and 
video equipment (microphones, microphone stands, mixer boards, TV 
monitors, etc.), walkie talkies, tables and chairs, penny machines, photo 
booths, vending machines, etc. 
8
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
 
• Instruct workers to wipe down and disinfect equipment that passes 
between workers and guests such as pens, reusable maps, etc. 
• Provide disposable or single-use maps, pamphlets, guides, etc. to guests 
and make these available digitally so that guests can view on a personal 
electronic device, if possible. If single-use items cannot be provided, 
properly disinfect reusable ones before and after customer use. 
• To the extent it is consistent with the facility’s obligations to individuals with 
disabilities, discontinue the use of audio headsets, strollers, etc., and other 
equipment lent to guests unless it can be properly disinfected after each 
use. Consult equipment manufacturers to determine appropriate 
disinfection steps, particularly for soft, porous surfaces such as foam 
earmuffs. 
• Equip workplace terminals with proper sanitation products, including hand 
sanitizer and sanitizing wipes. 
• Ensure that sanitary facilities for workers and guests stay operational and 
stocked at all times and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand 
sanitizer when needed. Provide hand sanitizer and portable sinks for 
visitors where possible at high traffic areas such as entrances. 
• Consider installing and encouraging the use of hands-free devices, if 
possible, including touchless time clocks, motion sensor lights, and 
automatic soap and paper towel dispensers. 
• When choosing cleaning disinfecting chemicals, employers should use 
products approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. 
Use disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral 
pathogens, diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon 
of water), or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are 
appropriate for the surface. Provide workers training on the chemical 
hazards, manufacturer’s directions, ventilation requirements, and 
Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or 
disinfectants should wear gloves and other protective equipment as 
required by the product instructions. Follow the asthma-safer cleaning 
methods recommended by the California Department of Public Health 
and ensure proper ventilation. 
• To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated 
with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features are 
safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown. 
• Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that 
can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter 
wherever possible. 
9
----------------Page (8) Break----------------
 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the 
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other 
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in all 
working areas. 
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift. 
Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as part of 
the workers’ job duties. 
• Modify hours, if necessary, to ensure regular, thorough cleaning of 
workspaces, as appropriate. Procure options for third-party cleaning 
companies to assist with the increased cleaning demand, as needed. 
 
 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between workers and guests and between people waiting in lines. This 
can include use of physical partitions, Plexiglas barriers, or visual cues 
(e.g., floor markings or signs to indicate to where workers and guests 
should stand). 
• Designate separate routes for entry and exit through exhibits, galleries, 
viewing areas and workspaces to help maintain physical distancing and 
lessen the instances of people closely passing each other, if possible. 
Establish one-way directional walkways, passageways, hallways, etc. for 
foot traffic, if possible, to minimize crossflow of people moving around 
exhibit and workspaces. 
• Display signage at entrances, waiting and viewing areas, and throughout 
exhibit spaces to remind people of physical distancing, face coverings 
usage, and proper hand hygiene at every opportunity. 
• Discourage workers and visitors from congregating in high traffic areas 
such as bathrooms and hallways. Dedicate staff to direct guests at high 
traffic and bottleneck areas in indoor and outdoor facilities to avoid 
congregation. 
• Adjust maximum occupancy rules to limit the number of people at 
museums as appropriate to support physical distancing. 
• Consider implementing timed and/or advanced reservation ticketing 
systems to stagger patron visits and help maintain physical distances. 
• Reconfigure viewing areas for live demonstrations, animal shows, etc. so 
that physical distancing can be maintained between household units. 
Consider implementing advanced reservations for demonstrations and 
having staff members usher households to proper viewing areas. 
10
----------------Page (9) Break----------------
 
• Limit customer groups entering the facility to a household unit. People 
from the same household do not need to physically distance from one 
another. 
• Discontinue tours that combine households or individuals from different 
households into the same tour group. Tour guides must maintain at least six 
feet of physical distance from guests. 
• Rearrange seating areas, tables, chairs, benches, etc., and/or remove 
seats to allow for a minimum of six feet of physical distance between 
users. Post signage at shared, immovable seating (benches, etc.) to 
remind guests to physically distance from others outside their party. 
• Consider removing, closing, sectioning off, or otherwise regulating 
interactive exhibits such as those with touchscreens, grab handles, 
buttons, telephone and other listening devices, handheld props, flip doors, 
etc. Consider providing disposable stylus pens, disposable covers, 
stationing a staff member to monitor and disinfect surfaces after each 
use, etc. Make hand sanitizer and/or handwashing facilities available at 
these stations and ask visitors to use them before and after interacting 
with exhibits. Strongly consider closing these exhibits whenever possible, 
especially when children are likely to interact with or share use of these 
exhibits without proper disinfection and hand sanitation. 
• Close indoor playgrounds, play areas, climbing structures, etc., in 
accordance with CDC guidelines. 
• Consider offering workers, docents, interns, and volunteer staff who 
request modified duties options that minimize their contact with guests 
and other workers (e.g., managing inventory rather than working as a 
cashier or managing administrative needs through telework). 
• Utilize work practices, when feasible and necessary, to limit the number of 
workers in shared workspaces at one time. This may include scheduling 
(e.g., staggering start/end times), establishing alternating days for on-site 
reporting, returning to workspaces in phases, or continued use of telework 
when feasible. 
• Reconfigure office spaces, workstations, check-out counters, etc. to allow 
for at least six feet between workers while at their workstations. 
• Reconfigure, restrict, or close breakrooms and create alternative space 
for breaks where physical distancing is possible. Limit the number of 
people riding in an elevator at one time. 
• Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to 
maintain physical distancing protocols. 
• Eliminate person-to-person contact for delivery of goods to worksites. 
11
----------------Page (10) Break----------------
•If possible, install transfer-aiding materials, such as shelving and bulletin
boards, to reduce person-to-person hand-offs.
•Redesign parking lots to limit congregation points and ensure proper
separation (e.g. every other space or row, contactless payment, etc.)
•Avoid sharing vehicles when traveling on the property, if possible.
Museums, galleries, botanical gardens, zoos, aquariums, etc., should limit
shuttle service whenever possible and in accordance with obligations to
individuals with disabilities. Employers should follow this guidance in
addition to applicable transit guidance as it becomes available on the
COVID-19 Resilience Roadmap website.
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Employers must 
comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as 
guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California 
Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers must be prepared to alter 
their operations as those guidelines change.
