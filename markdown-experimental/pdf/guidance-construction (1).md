OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population.  
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact with an infected person, even if that person does not have any 
symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, warehouses, 
meat processing plants, and grocery stores.  
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public.  
Key prevention practices include: 
✓ physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,  
✓ use of face coverings by employees (where respiratory protection is not 
required) and customers/clients,  
✓ frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, 
✓ training employees on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention 
plan. 
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus.  
Purpose  
This This document provides guidance for the construction industry to support a safe, 
clean environment for workers. The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any 
employee rights, either statutory, regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not 
exhaustive, as it does not include county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any 
existing safety and health-related regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 
Stay current on changes to public health guidance and state/local orders, as the 
COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has more safety and health guidance on their 
Cal/OSHA COVID-19 Infection Prevention for Construction Employers and Employees 
webpage. CDC has additional guidance for businesses and employers.

Work Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, worksite-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every 
facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas, and 
designate a person at each facility to implement the plan. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
facility is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among employees. 
• Train and communicate with employees and employee representatives 
on the plan. 
• Regularly evaluate the workplace for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as 
needed to prevent further cases. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 10 minutes or more) of an 
infected employee and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive 
employee(s) and close contacts.  
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
 
 
Topics for Employee Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to 
contracting the virus.  
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks 
using CDC guidelines.  
• The importance of not coming to work if employees have a frequent 
cough, fever, difficulty breathing, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore 
throat, recent loss of taste or smell, or if they or someone they live with 
have been diagnosed with COVID-19.  
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage.

• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including 
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 
60% ethanol or 70% isopropanol when employees cannot get to a sink or 
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time 
(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE).   
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not 
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing.  
o Employees should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings.  
o Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings should be washed after each shift.  
 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any personnel entering the facility. Make sure 
the temperature/symptom screener avoids close contact with workers to 
the extent possible. Both screeners and employees should wear face 
coverings for the screening.  
• Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to 
stay home. 
• Employers should provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment. Employers should consider where disposable glove use may 
be helpful to supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; 
examples are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or 
handling commonly touched items. 
• Face coverings strongly recommended when employees are in the 
vicinity of others.  Workers should have face coverings available and 
wear them when on-site, in breakrooms and offices or in a vehicle for 
work-related travel when traveling with others. Face coverings must not 
be shared.  
• Non-employees entering the jobsite should be restricted to only those 
classified as essential by management and they must complete a 
----------------Page (3) Break----------------

temperature and/or symptom screening before entering. Delivery drivers, 
vendors, and all others entering the facility are required to wear face 
coverings. 
 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Perform thorough cleaning on high traffic areas such as break rooms, 
lunch areas, and changing areas, and areas of ingress and egress 
including, stairways and stairwells, handrails, elevators controls and 
frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces, including, doorknobs, 
toilets, handwashing facilities, etc. 
• Clean touchable surfaces between shifts or between users, whichever is 
more frequent, including but not limited to working surfaces, tools, 
handles and latches, and controls on stationary and mobile equipment, 
including surfaces in the cabs of all vehicles. 
• Require workers to wash hands or use sanitizer between the use of shared 
equipment, such as workstation tools, radios, time clocks, mobilized carts, 
and other items and allow paid work time to do so. 
• Require that employer-owned and controlled equipment, such as hard 
hats and any face shields, be sanitized at the end of each shift. Clean 
and disinfect the inside of the equipment, then the outside, then wash 
hands. 
• Encourage workers who own their own hard hats to follow the same 
cleaning protocol and provide the proper cleaning and sanitation 
products. Allow paid work time to complete such cleaning. 
• Avoid sharing phones, office supplies, other work tools, or handheld 
mobile communications equipment wherever possible. Individually-
assigned peripheral equipment (keyboards, handsets, headsets, chairs, 
etc.) should be provided wherever possible. If necessary, clean and 
disinfect them before and after each use. Never share PPE. 
• Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times 
and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when 
needed.  
• Provide additional sanitary facilities (including portable toilets and 
handwashing stations) if feasible and necessary to maintain physical 
distancing during scheduled breaks. 
• Install hands-free devices, if possible, including motion sensor sinks, soap 
dispensers, sanitizer dispensers, and paper towel dispensers.

• When choosing cleaning chemicals, employers should use product 
approved for use against COVID-19 listed on the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. 
Use disinfectant labels labeled to be effective against emerging viral 
pathogens, diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon 
of water), or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are 
appropriate for the surface. Provide employees training on 
manufacturer’s directions and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. 
Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should wear gloves as required by 
the product instructions. 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the 
building or construction trailer’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, 
and making other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air 
and ventilation in work and break areas. 
 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between workers. These can include use of physical partitions or visual 
cues (e.g., floor markings or signs to indicate to where workers should 
stand). Reassign personal staging areas to increase distance between 
employees. Designate separate entrance and exits and post signage to 
this effect.  
• Adjust on-site meetings to ensure physical distance and instead 
implement smaller individual safety meetings at the jobsite to maintain 
physical distancing guidelines. Transition other meetings and interviews to 
phone or digital platforms or hold outside or in a space allowing for at 
least six feet of physical distance between employees. 
• Utilize work practices, when feasible and necessary, to limit the number of 
workers on the jobsite at one time. This may include scheduling (e.g. 
staggering shift start/end times) or rotating crew access to a designated 
area during a shift. Stage the jobsite to stagger work and limit overlap of 
work crews. Place additional limitations on the number of workers in 
enclosed areas, where six feet of separation may not be sufficient to limit 
transmission of the virus. 
• Stagger employee breaks, within compliance with wage and hour 
regulations, to maintain physical distancing protocols.  
• Close breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance between 
tables/chairs to separate workers and discourage congregating during 
breaks. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade covers 
and seating that ensures physical distancing.

• Workers should consider bringing a lunch made at home or purchase 
take out or delivery where available as long as they can avoid 
congested areas.  
• Use the following hierarchy to prevent transmission of COVID-19 in 
production and other work areas: engineering controls, administrative 
controls, and PPE. 
o Engineering controls include creating physical or spatial barriers 
between employees such as Plexiglas or other sturdy and 
impermeable partitions. Where appropriate, install such barriers in 
offices to create separation between workers. 
o Administrative controls include slowing operations and increasing 
shifts, within safety requirements, and ensuring adequate time for 
proper cleaning and disinfection protocols.  
o PPE includes face shields, respiratory protection, and impermeable 
gloves. Note that some equipment such as some disposable face 
shields and N95 respirators are prioritized for health care workers. If 
those are in use, consider changing to reusable elastomeric 
respirators to conserve supplies for healthcare facilities. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1 Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Employers must 
comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as 
guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California 
Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers must be prepared to alter their 
operations as those guidelines change.
