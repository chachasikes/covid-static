OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that 
person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not
required) and customers/clients,
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention
plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for facilities that process or pack meat, dairy, or 
produce to support a safe, clean environment for workers. The guidance is not 
intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, regulatory or 
collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include county health 
orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related regulatory 
requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public health 
guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has 
more comprehensive guidance on their Cal/OSHA Interim General Guidelines on 
Protecting Workers from COVID-19 webpage. CDC and federal OSHA have specific 
guidelines for Meat and Poultry Processing.

Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or
distribution to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance;
•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When
no passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering requirements 
in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. 
Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the 
reasonable cost of obtaining them. 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one 
of the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot 
wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if 
feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude 
any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying 
with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these 
exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Worksite Specific Plan 
•Establish a written, worksite-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every
location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and
work tasks, and designate a person at each establishment to implement
the plan.
•Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions.
•Identify contact information for the local health department where
the operation is located for communicating information about
COVID-19 outbreaks among workers or customers.
•Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on
the plan and make the plan available to workers and their
representatives.
•Regularly evaluate the establishment for compliance with the plan
and document and correct deficiencies identified.
•Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan
as needed to prevent further cases.
•Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a
workplace has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH
guidelines.
•Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of
an infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive
worker(s) and close contacts.
•Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in
workplace illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed
or limited.
Topics for Worker Training 
•Information  on COVID-19,  how  to  prevent  it  from  spreading,  and
which   underlying   health conditions   may   make   individuals   more
susceptible to contracting the virus.
•Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks
using CDC guidelines.
•The importance of not coming to work:

o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, 
such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty 
breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of 
taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea, OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR 
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone 
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered 
potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 
10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms 
have improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of 
fever reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without 
symptoms who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only 
if 10 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 
test. 
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, 
including persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish 
lips orface. Updates and further details are available on CDC’s 
webpage. 
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, 
including scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer 
with at least 60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the 
product is inaccessible to unsupervised children) when workers 
cannot get to a sink or handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The  importance  of  physical  distancing,  both  at  work  and  off  work 
time (see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not 
personal protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do 
not replace the need for physical distancing and frequent 
handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth.

o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or discarded 
after each shift. 
• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, 
and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face 
coverings. Training should also include the employer’s policies on how 
people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will be 
handled. 
• Ensure any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at 
the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and 
have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of 
time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive 
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional 
information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers’ 
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under 
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and workers’ rights to 
workers’ compensation benefits and presumption of the work-
relatedness of COVID-19 pursuant to the Governor’s Executive Order N-
62-20 while that Order is in effect. 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any personnel entering the facility. Make sure 
the temperature/symptom screener avoids close contact with workers to 
the extent possible. 
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to 
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed 
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC 
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. 
• Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to 
stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to 
supplement  frequent  handwashing  or  use of  hand  sanitizer;  examples 
are  for  workers  who  are  screening  others  for  symptoms  or  handling 
commonly touched items.

• Non-workers entering the facility should be restricted to only those 
classified as essential by management and should complete a 
temperature and/or symptom screening before entering. Contractors, 
drivers, and all U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) or U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) inspectors, and other regulatory officials 
entering the plant should wear face coverings. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas, such as break rooms, 
lunch areas, changing areas, workstations and areas of ingress and 
egress including stairways, stairwells, handrails, and elevator 
controls. Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces, including 
time clocks, bathroom fixtures, break room tables and chairs, locker 
rooms, and vending machines. 
• Implement disinfection procedures in non-production areas (welfare 
areas, hallways, etc.) to support enhanced hand hygiene practices. 
• All tools, equipment and controls should be cleaned between shifts or 
between users, whichever is more frequent. Coordinate cleaning 
product use with the USDA and/or FDA if used in food production 
areas. 
• Ensure delivery vehicles and equipment are cleaned before and after 
delivery routes, carry additional sanitation materials during deliveries, 
and use clean personal protective equipment for each delivery stop. 
• Avoid sharing phones, desks, offices, or other work tools and 
equipment, when possible. If necessary, clean and disinfect them 
before and after each use. 
• Hard hats and face shields must be sanitized at the end of each shift. 
Clean the inside of the face shield, then the outside, then wash 
hands. 
• Ensure sanitary facilities (restrooms and handwashing stations with 
soap and hand sanitizer) are provided at all workplaces. Ensure that 
these facilities stay operational and stocked at all times and provide 
additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when needed. No-
touch sinks, soap dispensers, sanitizer dispensers, and paper towel 
dispensers should be installed whenever possible. 
• To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases 
associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and 
features are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown. 
• Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods

that can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA 
filter wherever possible. 
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their 
shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours 
as part of the worker’s job duties. 
• Stagger breaks and provide additional sanitary facilities if feasible 
and necessary to maintain physical distancing during scheduled 
breaks. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use products 
approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. Use 
disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, 
diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), 
or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the 
surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, 
manufacturer’s directions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA 
requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should 
wear gloves and other protective equipment as required by the product 
instructions. Follow the asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended 
by the California Department of Public Health and ensure proper 
ventilation. 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the 
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making 
other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and 
ventilation in offices and other spaces. 
• If fans are used in the facility, ensure that fans blow clean air at the 
workers' breathing zone. 
• Modify offerings in on-site cafeterias, including using prepackaged 
foods, and safe options for drink, condiment, and flatware dispensing. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Food processing workers often work in close proximity on industrial 
equipment and lines. In order to ensure these workers’ safety, physical 
distancing in the workplace must be practiced. Implement measures to 
ensure physical distancing of at least six feet between workers whenever 
possible. This can include use of physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., 
floor markings, colored tape, or signs to indicate to where workers should 
stand). 
• Modify the alignment of workstations, including along processing lines, if 
feasible, so that workers are at least six feet apart in all directions (e.g.,

side-to-side and when facing one another). Ideally, modify the 
alignment of workstations so that workers do not face one another. 
Consider using markings and signs to remind workers to maintain their 
location at their station away from each other and practice physical 
distancing on breaks. 
• Use physical barriers, such as strip curtains, Plexiglas or similar materials, or 
other impermeable dividers or partitions, to separate packing or 
processing workers from each other, if feasible. 
• Designate workers to monitor and facilitate distancing on processing 
floor lines. 
• If necessary to ensure physical distancing, increase the number of shifts 
in a day, slow down the line speeds, and space out workers in 
accordance with CDC guidelines. Practice six-foot physical distancing 
to the greatest extent possible, even if this means production slows 
down. 
• Employers may determine that adjusting processing or production lines, 
shifts, and staggering workers across shifts would help to maintain overall 
packing or processing capacity while measures to minimize exposure to 
the virus are in place. For example, a plant that normally operates on 
one daytime shift may be able to split workers into two or three shifts 
throughout a 24-hour period. In packing or processing plants, one shift 
may need to be reserved for cleaning and sanitization. 
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., 
managing inventory rather than working as a cashier or managing 
administrative needs through telework). 
• Consider cohorting (grouping together) workers. This can increase the 
effectiveness of altering the plant’s normal shift schedules by making 
sure that groups of workers are always assigned to the same shifts with 
the same coworkers. Cohorting may reduce the spread of workplace 
transmission by minimizing the number of different individuals who come 
into close contact with each other over the course of a week. Cohorting 
may also reduce the number of workers quarantined because of 
exposure to the virus. 
• Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas 
to ensure at least six feet of separation to limit transmission of the virus. 
• One-way pathways should be delineated to avoid workers coming into 
close contact in narrow hallways. 
• Modify or stagger start times and alternate locker locations to increase 
physical distancing inside locker rooms and at the time clock.

• Because food processing workers often have uniform break times, which 
can mean hundreds of workers congregating in break rooms and 
cafeteria spaces at once, stagger breaks to limit the number of workers 
in a break room or cafeteria at the same time. 
• Add barriers, remove or rearrange chairs and tables, or add partitions to 
tables, in break rooms and other areas workers may frequent to increase 
worker separation and ensure workers do not face each other. Identify 
alternative areas to accommodate overflow volume such as training 
and conference rooms or using outside tents for break and lunch areas. 
• Limit the number of individuals in meetings and limit the number of 
participants in new hire orientations and other trainings. Provide virtual 
meeting and training opportunities wherever possible. 
• Implement protocols to keep drivers in their trucks while on property, 
providing them a non-contact delivery protocol at the security gate. 
• Designate drop-off locations to receive deliveries away from on-site high 
traffic areas. Maintain physical distance of at least six feet from delivery 
drivers. Do not shake hands. 
• Call recipients ahead when making deliveries. Deliver to confirmed 
drop-off locations that eliminate physical contact with recipients. 
• Encourage workers to avoid carpooling to and from work, if possible. If 
carpooling or using company shuttle vehicles is a necessity for workers, 
the following control practices should be used: 
o Limit the number of people per vehicle as much as possible. This may 
mean using more vehicles. 
o Encourage workers to maintain physical distancing as much as 
possible within the vehicle. 
o Encourage workers to use hand hygiene before entering the 
vehicle and when arriving at the destination. 
o Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces after each carpool 
or shuttle trip (e.g., door handles, handrails, seat belts, seat belt 
buckles). 
o Encourage workers to follow coughing and sneezing etiquette 
when in the vehicle.

Additional Guidelines 
• Visit the California Department of Food and Agriculture COVID-19 
Website for additional guidance on: 
o Livestock Markets, 
o Farmers Markets, 
o Farms and Ranches, 
o Nurseries 
o Other related facilities 
• See the CDC’s update on Meat and Poultry Processing Facilities for 
additional guidance. 
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. The food packing and 
processing industry must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its 
guidance as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and 
the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers must be prepared 
to alter their operations as those guidelines change.
