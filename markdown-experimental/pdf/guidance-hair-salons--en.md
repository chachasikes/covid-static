COVID-19 
INDUSTRY 
GUIDANCE: 
Hair Salons and 
Barbershops 
October 20, 2020 
This guidance is designed to address 
sectors and activities opening statewide. 
However, local health officers may 
implement more stringent rules tailored 
to local epidemiological conditions, so 
employers should also confirm relevant 
local opening policies.

OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at 
home to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that 
may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with 
serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at 
higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when 
people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, 
even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available 
at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating 
that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of 
these workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, restaurants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not required) and
customers/clients,
frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus.

PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for hair salons and barbershops to support a safe, 
clean environment for workers and customers. Hair salons and barbershops are open 
for operations across all tiers but must follow this guidance. 
Hair salon or barbershop owners or operators must acknowledge that lessees should 
only resume operations when they are ready and able to implement the necessary 
safety measures to provide for their safety and that of their customers. For the most 
updated information on county tier status, visit Blueprint for a Safer Economy. Please 
note that local health departments can have more restrictive criteria and different 
closures. Find your county’s local information. 
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA or the California Board of 
Barbering and Cosmetology.1 Stay current on changes to public health guidance 
and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has more 
comprehensive guidance on their Cal/OSHA General Guidelines on Protecting 
Workers from COVID-19 webpage. CDC has additional requirements in their 
guidance for businesses and employers. 
Required Use of Face Coverings
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. Complete 
details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be found in the 
guidance.  
The CDPH Face Covering Guidance is subject to additional updates based on the 
current scientific understanding of transmission of the virus causing COVID-19. Please 
check the CDPH website for any revisions.

Workplace Specific Plan 
•Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every
location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and
work tasks, and designate a person at each facility to implement the plan.
•Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions.
•Identify contact information for the local health department where the
facility is located for communicating information about COVID-19
outbreaks among workers or customers.
•Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives.
•Regularly evaluate the facility for compliance with the plan and document
and correct deficiencies identified.
•Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related factors
could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as needed to
prevent further cases.
•Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines and orders or
guidance from the local health department.
•Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) and
close contacts.
•Notify all employees in writing, and employers of subcontracted
employees, who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and report
workplace outbreaks to the local health department. For additional
information on employer responsibilities under AB 685 (Chapter 84,
Statutes of 2020), refer to the Enhanced Enforcement and Employer
Reporting Requirements from Cal/OSHA and the Employer Questions
about AB 685 from CDPH.
•Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited.
Topics for Worker Training 
•Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which
people are at higher risk for severe illness or death.
•Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks

----------------Page (3) Break----------------
using CDC Guidelines. 
•The importance of not coming to work:
oIf a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, such
as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,
fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell,
sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea,
OR
oIf a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been
released from isolation, OR
oIf, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered potentially
infectious (i.e. still on isolation).
•To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only after
meeting CDPH Guidance on Returning to Work or School Following
COVID-19 Diagnosis.
•To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face.
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage.
•The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible to
unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or handwashing
station, per CDC guidelines). Never use hand sanitizers with methanol due
to its high toxicity to both children and adults.
•The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time (see
Physical Distancing section below).
•Proper use of face coverings, including:
oFace coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE).
oFace coverings do not replace the need for physical distancing and
frequent handwashing.
oFace coverings must cover the nose and mouth.
oWorkers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or
adjusting face coverings.
oAvoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth.
oFace coverings must not be shared and should be washed or
discarded after each shift.

•Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings.
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled.
•Ensure independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers are also
properly trained in COVID- 19 prevention policies and have necessary
supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of time with
organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers.
•Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional
information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers’
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
•Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the
beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers
entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom screener
avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible.
•If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above.
•Encourage workers and customers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of
COVID-19 to stay home.
•Hair salon or barbershop operators must provide and ensure workers use all
required protective equipment, including eye protection, face shields, and
protective gloves when necessary.
•Hair salon or barbershop operators should consider where disposable glove
use may be helpful to supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand
sanitizer; examples are for workers who are screening others for symptoms
or handling commonly touched items.
•Disposable gloves should be worn for services that require them (e.g.
chemical hair services). Wearing gloves should be done in conjunction with
regular hand washing and is not a substitute for regular hand washing.
•Workers should consider using glasses, goggles, or face shields in addition
to face coverings during the provision of services, particularly during face
to face encounters.

----------------Page (5) Break----------------
• Contact customers before visits to confirm appointments and ask if they or 
someone in their household is exhibiting any COVID-19 symptoms. If the 
customer answers in the affirmative reschedule the appointment. Request 
customers to bring and use face coverings during the visit. If appropriate 
for the service, consider asking customers to come to the salon with their 
hair freshly cleaned in order to minimize time for the appointment. 
Customers should be asked not to bring children or others with them to the 
appointment. 
• Remind guests in advance to bring a face covering, otherwise they 
should not be allowed to enter the premises (unless exempted per the 
CDPH Face Covering Guidance). Consider making face coverings 
available for guests who may arrive without them. 
• Customers should be screened upon arrival. Be prepared to cancel or 
reschedule customers who indicate they have any signs of illness. 
Operators have the right to cancel reservations for individuals/parties 
with symptomatic guests and refuse entry. 
• Display a set of guidelines for customers that are to be a condition of entry. 
The guidelines must include instructions to wear face coverings, use hand 
sanitizer, maintain physical distance from other customers, and they should 
communicate changes to service offerings. The guidelines should be 
posted in clearly visible locations, including at entrances, include 
pictograms, and be made available digitally (e.g. through email). 
 
Ventilation, Cleaning, and Disinfecting 
Protocols  
• Where possible, install portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrade the 
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and make other 
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in all 
working areas and other indoor spaces. 
• Check the CDPH website periodically for updates on indoor air quality and 
ventilation guidance for airborne diseases in indoor settings. 
• Coordinate with coworkers, fellow tenants, booth renters and/or workers 
and put a plan in place for cleaning at the beginning and end of each 
shift and in between customers. Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic 
areas, such as reception areas, and areas of ingress and egress including 
stairways, stairwells, and handrails. 
• Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces including credit card 
terminals, counters, reception area seating, door handles, light switches, 
phones, toilets, and handwashing facilities. 
7
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
•Encourage the use of credit cards and contactless payment systems. If
electronic or card payment is not possible, customers should come with
exact cash payment or check.
•Consider upgrading to touchless faucets, soap and paper towel
dispensers, and adding touchless, automatic hand sanitizer dispensers.
Remove any unnecessary products that do not belong in the restroom, e.g.
candles or beauty supplies, and ensure soap dispensers and paper towel
dispensers are regularly filled.
•To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated
with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems are safe to use after
a prolonged facility shutdown.
•Equip reception areas and workstations with proper sanitation products,
including hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes.
•Thoroughly clean any product display areas, including all shelving and
display cases. Remove and discard any open “test” products and
discontinue this practice to help reduce contamination. Add signage to
this area to let customers know it is cleaned and disinfected daily.
•Workstations must be routinely and frequently cleaned, including between
each customer appointment. Thoroughly clean and disinfect the station
counters, rolling carts, drawers, hand mirrors, hair care and other products,
and containers and provide a new smock or cape for each customer.
•Clean and disinfect shears by removing all visible debris, clean with soap
and water, and wipe or spray with an EPA-registered disinfectant that
demonstrates bactericidal, fungicidal, and virucidal activity and is
approved for COVID-19.
•Clean and disinfect all non-electrical tools by removing all visible debris,
cleaning with soap and water, drying the tools, and then completely
immersing them in an EPA registered disinfectant. Tools should be sprayed
or submerged and left to set for the full amount of time required by the
disinfectant’s manufacturer. Immersed items, like combs or brushes, should
be removed at the end of contact time, rinsed, and dried with a paper
towel or clean, freshly laundered towel.
•Clean all electrical tools, such as clippers, by removing all visible debris and
disinfecting with an EPA-registered disinfectant spray or wipe that
demonstrates bactericidal, fungicidal, and virucidal activity and is
approved for COVID-19.
•Clean and disinfect all handles, hoses, spray nozzles, and other equipment
before and after use on a customer. Chairs, headrests, shampoo bowls,
and other items should also be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized between
each use.
8
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
•Where appropriate, consider adding a paper cover, sheet, or clean towel
that can be easily disposed of or cleaned for use between customers.
•All single use items, such as disposable wax collars, cotton, neck strips, and
applicators, must be used once and immediately thrown away. Product
samples, including make-up, must not be used at any time.
•All dirty linens, including towels, smocks, and reusable capes, should be
placed in a closed container and not used again until properly laundered
either by a commercial laundering service or a laundering process which
includes immersion in water of at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit for at least
25 minutes. Store all clean linens in a clean, covered place. Ensure workers
who handle dirty linens or laundry wear gloves.
•Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that can
disperse pathogens into the air unless all persons in the area have
appropriate PPE. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever possible.
•Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift.
Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as part of
the worker’s job duties.
•When choosing disinfecting chemicals, use products approved for use
against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-
approved list and follow product instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to
be effective against emerging viral pathogens, diluted household bleach
solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or alcohol solutions with at
least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the surface. Provide workers
training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer’s directions, ventilation
requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers using
cleaners or disinfectants must wear gloves and other protective equipment
as required by the product. Follow the asthma-safer cleaning methods
recommended by the California Department of Public Health and ensure
proper ventilation.
•Hair salon or barbershop workers should avoid sharing phones, tablets,
laptops, desks, pens, other work supplies, wherever possible. Never share
PPE.
•In addition to the above cleaning and disinfecting protocols, hair salons,
barbershops, and other cosmetology businesses must follow the existing
California Board of Barbering and Cosmetology rules.

Physical Distancing Guidelines 
•WARNING: physical distancing alone is insufficient to prevent transmission
of COVID-19.
•Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet
between and among workers and customers, except when providing
haircutting and other close contact services. This can include use of
physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored tape, or signs
to indicate to where workers and/or customers should stand).
•Take measures at reception desks or other areas where physical distancing
cannot be maintained to minimize exposure between workers and
customers, such as Plexiglas or other barriers.
•Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., managing
inventory or managing administrative needs through telework).
•Stagger appointments to reduce reception congestion and ensure
adequate time for proper cleaning and sanitation between each
customer visit. Consider servicing fewer customers each day or expanding
operating hours to allow for more time between customers. Suspend walk-
in appointment availability.
•If possible, implement virtual check-in technology to ensure that workers
are notified when a customer arrives. Ask customers to wait outside or in
their cars rather than congregating in the salon or barbershop. In larger
locations, reception areas should only have one customer at a time or
modify the area for adequate physical distancing, including removing
chairs and sofas.
•Wherever possible, doors should be left open if they do not open and close
automatically.
•Require workers to avoid handshakes, hugs, and similar greetings or other
behaviors that break physical distance.
•Discourage workers from congregating in high traffic areas, such as
bathrooms, hallways, or credit card terminals.
•Ensure workers can maintain physical distance in breakrooms, using
barriers, increasing distance between tables/chairs to separate workers,
etc. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade coverings and
seating arrangements that ensures physical distancing. Discourage workers
from congregating during breaks and ensure they are not eating or
drinking without face coverings within six feet of each other.
•Adjust any staff meetings to ensure physical distancing. Hold meetings over
the phone or via webinar for workers wherever possible.

1 Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Hair salons and 
barbershops must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its 
guidance as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and 
the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers should be prepared 
to alter their operations as those guidelines change.
