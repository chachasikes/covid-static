COVID-19 
INDUSTRY 
GUIDANCE: 
Schools and School- 
Based Programs 
 
Updated: August 3, 2020  
  
All guidance should be implemented 
only with local health officer approval 
following their review of local 
epidemiological data including cases 
per 100,000 population, rate of test 
positivity, and local preparedness to 
support a health care surge, vulnerable 
populations, contact tracing, and 
testing.

OVERVIEW 
Communities across the state are preparing for the forthcoming school year. To assist 
with that planning process, the following guidelines and considerations are intended 
to help school and community leaders plan and prepare to resume in-person 
instruction. 
This guidance is interim and subject to updates. These guidelines and considerations 
are based on the best available public health data at this time, international best 
practices currently employed, and the practical realities of managing school 
operations; as new data and practices emerge. Additionally, the guidelines and 
considerations do not reflect the full scope of issues that school communities will need 
to address, which range from day-to-day site-based logistics to the social and 
emotional well-being of students and staff. 
California public schools (traditional and charter), private schools (including nonpublic 
nonsectarian schools), school districts, and county offices of education, herein referred 
to as schools, will determine the most appropriate instructional model, taking into 
account the needs of their students and staff, and their available infrastructure. This 
guidance is not intended to prevent a school from adopting a distance learning, 
hybrid, or mixed-delivery instructional model to ensure safety. Schools are not required 
to seek out or receive approval from a state or local public health officer prior to 
adopting a distance-learning model. 
Implementation of this guidance will depend on local public health conditions, 
including those listed here. Communities meeting those criteria, such as lower 
incidence of COVID-19 and adequate preparedness, may implement the guidance 
described below as part of a phased reopening. All decisions about following this 
guidance should be made in collaboration with local health officials and other 
authorities. 
Implementation of this guidance should be tailored for each setting, including 
adequate consideration of instructional programs operating at each school site and 
the needs of students and families. School leaders should engage relevant 
stakeholders—including families, staff and labor partners in the school community—to 
formulate and implement plans that consider the following: 
 Student, Family and Staff Population: Who are the student, family and staff 
populations who will be impacted by or can serve as partners in implementing 
any of the following measures? 
 Ability to Implement or Adhere to Measures: Do staff, students and families have 
the tools, information, resources and ability to successfully adhere to or 
implement the new measures? 
 Negative or Unintended Consequences: Are there any negative or unintended 
consequences to staff, students or families of implementing the measures and 
how can those consequences be mitigated? 
----------------Page (1) Break----------------
 
This guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA. Stay current on changes to public 
health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues.  
----------------Page (2) Break----------------
 
 
1. General Measures 
 Establish and continue communication with local and State authorities 
to determine current disease levels and control measures in your 
community. For example: 
o Review and refer to, if applicable, the relevant county variance 
documentation. Documentation can be found here. 
o Consult with your county health officer, or designated staff, who are 
best positioned to monitor and provide advice on local conditions. A 
directory can be found here. 
o Collaborate with other schools and school partners in your region, 
including the county office of education. 
o Regularly review updated guidance from state agencies, including 
the California Department of Public Health and California 
Department of Education. 
 Establish a written, worksite-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every 
facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and 
work tasks, and designate a person at each school to implement the 
plan. 
o Identify contact information for the local health department where 
the school is located for communicating information about COVID-
19 outbreaks among students or staff. 
o Incorporate the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face Coverings, into 
the School Site Specific Plan that includes a policy for handling 
exemptions. 
o Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on 
the plan. Make the written plan available and accessible to workers 
and worker representatives. 
o Regularly evaluate the workplace for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
o Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan 
as needed to prevent further cases. 
o Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a 
workplace has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
o Identify individuals who have been in close contact (within six feet for 
15 minutes or more) of an infected person and take steps to isolate 
----------------Page (3) Break----------------
 
COVID-19 positive person(s) and close contacts. See Section 10 for 
more detail. 
o Adhere to these guidelines. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause classrooms or the entire school to be 
temporarily closed or limited. 
 Evaluate whether and to what extent external community organizations 
can safely utilize the site and campus resources. Ensure external 
community organizations that use the facilities also follow this guidance. 
 Develop a plan for the possibility of repeated closures of classes, groups 
or entire facilities when persons associated with the facility or in the 
community become ill with COVID-19. See Section 10 below. 
 Develop a plan to further support students with access and functional 
needs who may be at increased risk of becoming infected or having 
unrecognized illness due to COVID-19. For example, review existing 
student health plans to identify students who may need additional 
accommodations, develop a process for engaging families for 
potentially unknown concerns that may need to be accommodated or 
identify additional preparations for classroom and non-classroom 
environments as needed. Groups who might be at increased risk of 
becoming infected or having unrecognized illness include the following: 
o Individuals who have limited mobility or require prolonged and close 
contact with others, such as direct support providers and family 
members; 
o Individuals who have trouble understanding information or practicing 
preventive measures, such as hand washing and physical distancing; 
and 
o Individuals who may not be able to communicate symptoms of 
illness. 
 Schools should review the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face Coverings 
and any applicable local health department guidance and incorporate 
face-covering use for students and workers into their COVID-19 
prevention plan. Some flexibility may be needed for younger children 
consistent with child development recommendations. See Section 3 for 
more information. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
 
 
2. Promote Healthy Hygiene Practices 
 Teach and reinforce washing hands, avoiding contact with one's eyes, 
nose, and mouth, and covering coughs and sneezes among students 
and staff. 
o Teach students and remind staff to use tissue to wipe their nose and 
to cough/sneeze inside a tissue or their elbow. 
o Students and staff should wash their hands frequently throughout the 
day, including before and after eating; after coughing or sneezing; 
after classes where they handle shared items, such as outside 
recreation, art, or shop; and before and after using the restroom. 
o Students and staff should wash their hands for 20 seconds with soap, 
rubbing thoroughly after application. Soap products marketed as 
“antimicrobial” are not necessary or recommended. 
o Staff should model and practice handwashing. For example, for 
lower grade levels, use bathroom time as an opportunity to reinforce 
healthy habits and monitor proper handwashing. 
o Students and staff should use fragrance-free hand sanitizer when 
handwashing is not practicable. Sanitizer must be rubbed into hands 
until completely dry. Note: frequent handwashing is more effective 
than the use of hand sanitizers. 
o Ethyl alcohol-based hand sanitizers are preferred and should be used 
when there is the potential of unsupervised use by children.  
 Isopropyl hand sanitizers are more toxic when ingested or 
absorbed in skin. 
 Do not use hand sanitizers that may contain methanol which can 
be hazardous when ingested or absorbed.   
o Children under age 9 should only use hand sanitizer under adult 
supervision. Call Poison Control if consumed: 1-800-222-1222. 
 Consider portable handwashing stations throughout a site and near 
classrooms to minimize movement and congregations in bathrooms to 
the extent practicable. 
 Develop routines enabling students and staff to regularly wash their 
hands at staggered intervals. 
 Ensure adequate supplies to support healthy hygiene behaviors, 
including soap, tissues, no-touch trashcans, face coverings, and hand 
sanitizers with at least 60 percent ethyl alcohol for staff and children who 
can safely use hand sanitizer. 
----------------Page (5) Break----------------
 
 Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings should be provided to staff and families, which discusses the 
circumstances in which face coverings must be worn and the 
exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and practices the 
employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. 
 Employers must provide and ensure staff use face coverings in 
accordance with CDPH guidelines and all required protective 
equipment.  
 The California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (CalOES) and 
the Department of Public Health (CDPH) are and will be working to 
support procurement and distribution of face coverings and personal 
protective equipment. Additional information can be found here. 
 Strongly recommend that all students and staff be immunized each 
autumn against influenza unless contraindicated by personal medical 
conditions, to help: 
o Protect the school community 
o Reduce demands on health care facilities  
o Decrease illnesses that cannot be readily distinguished from COVID-
19 and would therefore trigger extensive measures from the school 
and public health authorities. 
 Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted as restricting access to 
appropriate educational services. 
 
3. Face Coverings 
Face coverings must be used in accordance with CDPH guidelines unless a 
person is exempt as explained in the guidelines, particularly in indoor 
environments, on school buses, and areas where physical distancing alone is 
not sufficient to prevent disease transmission.  
 Teach and reinforce use of face coverings, or in limited instances, face 
shields.  
 Students and staff should be frequently reminded not to touch the face 
covering and to wash their hands frequently. 
 Information should be provided to all staff and families in the school 
community on proper use, removal, and washing of cloth face 
coverings. 
 Training should also include policies on how people who are exempted 
from wearing a face covering will be addressed. 
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
 
STUDENTS 
Age Face Covering Requirement 
Under 2 years old No 
2 years old – 2nd grade Strongly encouraged**   
3rd grade – High School Yes, unless exempt 
 
**Face coverings are strongly encouraged for young children between two years old 
and second grade, if they can be worn properly. A face shield is an acceptable 
alternative for children in this cohort who cannot wear them properly.  
 Persons younger than two years old, anyone who has trouble breathing, 
anyone who is unconscious or incapacitated, and anyone who is 
otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance are 
exempt from wearing a face covering.  
 A cloth face covering or face shield should be removed for meals, 
snacks, naptime, or outdoor recreation, or when it needs to be 
replaced. When a cloth face covering is temporarily removed, it should 
be placed in a clean paper bag (marked with the student’s name and 
date) until it needs to be put on again. 
 In order to comply with this guidance, schools must exclude students 
from campus if they are not exempt from wearing a face covering 
under CDPH guidelines and refuse to wear one provided by the school. 
Schools should develop protocols to provide a face covering to students 
who inadvertently fail to bring a face covering to school to prevent 
unnecessary exclusions. Schools should offer alternative educational 
opportunities for students who are excluded from campus.   
STAFF 
 All staff must use face coverings in accordance with CDPH guidelines 
unless Cal/OSHA standards require respiratory protection.  
 In limited situations where a face coverings cannot be used for 
pedagogical or developmental reasons, (i.e. communicating or assisting 
young children or those with special needs) a face shield can be used 
instead of a cloth face covering while in the classroom as long as the 
wearer maintains physical distance from others, to the extent 
practicable. Staff must return to wearing a face covering outside of the 
classroom. 
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
 
 Workers or other persons handling or serving food must use gloves in 
addition to face coverings. Employers should consider where disposable 
glove use may be helpful to supplement frequent handwashing or use of 
hand sanitizer; examples are for workers who are screening others for 
symptoms or handling commonly touched items.  
 
4. Ensure Teacher and Staff Safety 
 Ensuring staff maintain physical distancing from each other is critical to 
reducing transmission between adults.  
 Ensure that all staff use face coverings in accordance with CDPH 
guidelines and Cal/OSHA standards. 
 Support staff who are at higher risk for severe illness or who cannot safely 
distance from household contacts at higher risk, by providing options 
such as telework, where appropriate, or teaching in a virtual learning or 
independent study context. 
 Conduct all staff meetings, professional development training and 
education, and other activities involving staff with physical distancing 
measures in place, or virtually, where physical distancing is a challenge. 
 Minimize the use of and congregation of adults in staff rooms, break 
rooms, and other settings.  
 Implement procedures for daily symptom monitoring for staff. 
 
 
5. Intensify Cleaning, Disinfection, and 
Ventilation 
 Consider suspending or modifying use of site resources that necessitate 
sharing or touching items. For example, consider suspending use of 
drinking fountains and instead encourage the use of reusable water 
bottles. 
 Staff should clean and disinfect frequently-touched surfaces at school 
and on school buses at least daily and, as practicable, these surfaces 
should be cleaned and disinfected frequently throughout the day by 
trained custodial staff. 
 Buses should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected daily and after 
transporting any individual who is exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19. 
Drivers should be provided disinfectant wipes and disposable gloves to 
support disinfection of frequently touched surfaces during the day. 
----------------Page (8) Break----------------
 
 Frequently touched surfaces in the school include, but are not limited to: 
o Door handles 
o Light switches 
o Sink handles 
o Bathroom surfaces 
o Tables 
o Student Desks 
o Chairs 
 Limit use and sharing of objects and equipment, such as toys, games, art 
supplies and playground equipment to the extent practicable. When 
shared use is allowed, clean and disinfect between uses. 
 When choosing disinfecting products, use those approved for use 
against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-
approved list “N” and follow product instructions. 
o To reduce the risk of asthma and other health effects related to 
disinfecting, programs should select disinfectant products on list N 
with asthma-safer ingredients (hydrogen peroxide, citric acid or 
lactic acid) as recommended by the US EPA Design for Environment 
program. 
o Avoid products that contain peroxyacetic (peracetic) acid, sodium 
hypochlorite (bleach) or quaternary ammonium compounds, which 
can cause asthma. 
o Follow label directions for appropriate dilution rates and contact 
times. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, 
manufacturer’s directions, Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use, and 
as applicable and as required by the Healthy Schools Act.  
o Custodial staff and any other workers who clean and disinfect the 
school site must be equipped with proper protective equipment, 
including gloves, eye protection, respiratory protection, and other 
appropriate protective equipment as required by the product 
instructions. All products must be kept out of children’s reach and 
stored in a space with restricted access. 
o Establish a cleaning and disinfecting schedule in order to avoid both 
under- and over-use of cleaning products. 
 Ensure safe and correct application of disinfectant and keep products 
away from students. 
----------------Page (9) Break----------------
 
 Ensure proper ventilation during cleaning and disinfecting. Introduce 
fresh outdoor air as much as possible, for example, by opening windows 
where practicable. When cleaning, air out the space before children 
arrive; plan to do thorough cleaning when children are not present. If 
using air conditioning, use the setting that brings in outside air. Replace 
and check air filters and filtration systems to ensure optimal air quality. 
o If opening windows poses a safety or health risk (e.g., by allowing 
pollen in or exacerbating asthma symptoms) to persons using the 
facility, consider alternatives. For example, maximize central air 
filtration for HVAC systems (targeted filter rating of at least MERV 13). 
 Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the 
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other 
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in 
classrooms, offices and other spaces.  
 Take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (for example, 
drinking fountains and decorative fountains) are safe to use after a 
prolonged facility shutdown to minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease 
and other diseases associated with water. 
 
6. Implementing Distancing Inside and 
Outside the Classroom 
Arrival and Departure 
 
 Maximize space between students and between students and the driver 
on school buses and open windows to the greatest extent practicable. 
 Minimize contact at school between students, staff, families and the 
community at the beginning and end of the school day. Prioritize 
minimizing contact between adults at all times. 
 Stagger arrival and drop off-times and locations as consistently as 
practicable as to minimize scheduling challenges for families. 
 Designate routes for entry and exit, using as many entrances as feasible. 
Put in place other protocols to limit direct contact with others as much 
as practicable. 
 Implement health screenings of students and staff upon arrival at school 
(see Section 9). 
 Ensure each bus is equipped with extra unused face coverings on school 
buses for students who may have inadvertently failed to bring one. 
----------------Page (10) Break----------------
 
Classroom Space 
 
 To reduce possibilities for infection, students must remain in the same 
space and in cohorts as small and consistent as practicable, including 
for recess and lunch. Keep the same students and teacher or staff with 
each group, to the greatest extent practicable. 
 Prioritize the use and maximization of outdoor space for activities where 
practicable. 
 Minimize movement of students and teachers or staff as much as 
practicable. For example, consider ways to keep teachers with one 
group of students for the whole day.  In secondary schools or in situations 
where students have individualized schedules, plan for ways to reduce 
mixing among cohorts and to minimize contact.  
 Maximize space between seating and desks. Distance teacher and 
other staff desks at least six feet away from student desks. Consider ways 
to establish separation of students through other means if practicable, 
such as, six feet between desks, where practicable, partitions between 
desks, markings on classroom floors to promote distancing or arranging 
desks in a way that minimizes face-to-face contact. 
 Consider redesigning activities for smaller groups and rearranging 
furniture and play spaces to maintain separation.  
 Staff should develop instructions for maximizing spacing and ways to 
minimize movement in both indoor and outdoor spaces that are easy for 
students to understand and are developmentally appropriate.  
 Activities where there is increased likelihood for transmission from 
contaminated exhaled droplets such as band and choir practice and 
performances are not permitted.  
 Activities that involve singing must only take place outdoors. 
 Implement procedures for turning in assignments to minimize contact. 
 Consider using privacy boards or clear screens to increase and enforce 
separation between staff and students.  
----------------Page (11) Break----------------
 
Non-Classroom Spaces 
  
 Limit nonessential visitors, volunteers and activities involving other groups 
at the same time. 
 Limit communal activities where practicable. Alternatively, stagger use, 
properly space occupants and disinfect in between uses. 
 Consider use of non-classroom space for instruction, including regular 
use of outdoor space, weather permitting. For example, consider part-
day instruction outside. 
 Minimize congregate movement through hallways as much as 
practicable. For example, establish more ways to enter and exit a 
campus, create staggered passing times when necessary or when 
students cannot stay in one room and create guidelines on the floor that 
students can follow to enable physical distancing while passing.  In 
addition, schools can consider eliminating the use of lockers and moving 
to block scheduling, which supports the creation of cohort groups and 
reduces changes of classrooms. 
 Serve meals outdoors or in classrooms instead of cafeterias or group 
dining rooms where practicable.  Where cafeterias or group dining 
rooms must be used, keep students together in their cohort groups, 
ensure physical distancing, and consider assigned seating. Serve 
individually plated or bagged meals. Avoid sharing of foods and utensils 
and buffet or family-style meals. 
 Consider holding recess activities in separated areas designated by 
class. 
 
Sports and Extra Curricular Activities 
(Updated August 3, 2020) 
  
 Outdoor and indoor sporting events, assemblies, dances, rallies, field 
trips, and other activities that require close contact or that would 
promote congregating are not permitted at this time. For example, 
tournaments, events, or competitions, regardless of whether teams are 
from the same school or from different schools, counties, or states are 
not permitted at this time.  
 
 Youth sports and physical education are permitted only when the following 
can be maintained: (1) physical distancing of at least six feet; and (2) a 
stable cohort, such as a class, that limits the risks of transmission (see CDC 
Guidance on Schools and Cohorting). Activities should take place outside 
to the maximum extent practicable. 
----------------Page (12) Break----------------
 
 
 For sports that cannot be conducted with sufficient distancing or cohorting, 
only physical conditioning and training is permitted and ONLY where 
physical distancing can be maintained. Conditioning and training should 
focus on individual skill building (e.g., running drills and body weight 
resistance training) and should take place outside, where practicable. 
Indoor physical conditioning and training is allowed only in counties where 
gyms and fitness centers are allowed to operate indoors.   
 
 Avoid equipment sharing, and if unavoidable, clean and disinfect shared 
equipment between use by different people to reduce the risk of COVID-19 
spread. 
 
 Consistent with guidance for gyms and fitness facilities, cloth face coverings 
must be worn during indoor physical conditioning and training or physical 
education classes (except when showering). Activities that require heavy 
exertion should be conducted outside in a physically distanced manner 
without face coverings. Activities conducted inside should be those that do 
not require heavy exertion and can be done with a face covering. Players 
should take a break from exercise if any difficulty in breathing is noted and 
should change their mask or face covering if it becomes wet and sticks to 
the player’s face and obstructs breathing. Masks that restrict airflow under 
heavy exertion (such as N-95 masks) are not advised for exercise. 
 Youth sports programs and schools should provide information to 
parents or guardians regarding this and related guidance, along with 
the safety measures that will be in place in these settings with which 
parents or guardians must comply. 
 Activities where there is increased likelihood for transmission from 
contaminated exhaled droplets such as band and choir practice and 
performances are not permitted.  
 
7. Limit Sharing 
 Keep each child’s belongings separated and in individually labeled 
storage containers, cubbies or areas. Ensure belongings are taken home 
each day to be cleaned. 
 Ensure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high-touch materials (art 
supplies, equipment, etc.) to the extent practicable or limit use of 
supplies and equipment to one group of children at a time and clean 
and disinfect between uses. 
 Avoid sharing electronic devices, clothing, toys, books and other games 
or learning aids as much as practicable. Where sharing occurs, clean 
and disinfect between uses. 
----------------Page (13) Break----------------
 
 
 
8. Train All Staff and Educate Families 
 Train all staff and provide educational materials to families in the 
following safety actions: 
o Enhanced sanitation practices 
o Physical distancing guidelines and their importance 
o Proper use, removal, and washing of face coverings 
o Screening practices 
o How COVID-19 is spread 
o COVID-19 specific symptom identification 
o Preventing the spread of COVID-19 if you are sick, including the 
importance of not coming to work if staff members have symptoms, 
or if they or someone they live with has been diagnosed with COVID-
19. 
o For workers, COVID-19 specific symptom identification and when to 
seek medical attention 
o The employer’s plan and procedures to follow when children or 
adults become sick at school. 
o The employer’s plan and procedures to protect workers from COVID-
19 illness. 
 Consider conducting the training and education virtually, or, if in-person, 
ensure a minimum of six-foot distancing is maintained. 
 
9. Check for Signs and Symptoms 
 Prevent discrimination against students who (or whose families) were or 
are diagnosed with COVID-19 or who are perceived to be a COVID-19 
risk. 
 Actively encourage staff and students who are sick or who have 
recently had close contact with a person with COVID-19 to stay home. 
Develop policies that encourage sick staff and students to stay at home 
without fear of reprisal, and ensure staff, students and students’ families 
are aware of these policies. 
 Implement screening and other procedures for all staff and students 
entering the facility. 
----------------Page (14) Break----------------
 
 Conduct visual wellness checks of all students or establish procedures for 
parents to monitor at home. If checking temperatures, use a no-touch 
thermometer. 
 Ask all individuals if they or anyone in their home is exhibiting COVID-19 
symptoms. 
 Make available and encourage use of hand-washing stations or hand 
sanitizer. 
 Document/track incidents of possible exposure and notify local health 
officials, staff and families immediately of any exposure to a positive 
case of COVID-19 at school while maintaining confidentiality, as required 
under FERPA and state law related to privacy of educational records. 
Additional guidance can be found here. As noted in Section 11 below, 
the staff liaison can serve a coordinating role to ensure prompt and 
responsible notification. 
 If a student is exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, staff should 
communicate with the parent/caregiver and refer to the student’s 
health history form and/or emergency card. 
 Monitor staff and students throughout the day for signs of illness; send 
home students and staff with a fever of 100.4 degrees or higher, cough 
or other COVID-19 symptoms. 
 Policies should not penalize students and families for missing class. 
 
10.  Plan for When a Staff Member, Child or 
Visitor Becomes Sick 
 Work with school administrators, nurses and other healthcare providers to 
identify an isolation room or area to separate anyone who exhibits 
symptoms of COVID-19. 
 Any students or staff exhibiting symptoms should immediately be 
required to wear a face covering and be required to wait in an isolation 
area until they can be transported home or to a healthcare facility, as 
soon as practicable. 
 Establish procedures to arrange for safe transport home or to a 
healthcare facility, as appropriate, when an individual is exhibiting 
COVID-19 symptoms: 
o Fever 
o Cough 
o Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing 
----------------Page (15) Break----------------
 
o Chills 
o Repeated shaking with chills 
o Fatigue 
o Muscle pain 
o Headache 
o Sore throat 
o Congestion or runny nose 
o Nausea or vomiting 
o Diarrhea 
o New loss of taste or smell 
 For serious injury or illness, call 9-1-1 without delay. Seek medical 
attention if COVID-19 symptoms become severe, including persistent 
pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. Updates 
and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
 Notify local health officials immediately of any positive case of COVID-
19, and exposed staff and families as relevant while maintaining 
confidentiality as required by state and federal laws. Additional 
guidance can be found here. 
 Close off areas used by any individual suspected of being infected with 
the virus that causes COVID-19 and do not use before cleaning and 
disinfection. To reduce risk of exposure, wait 24 hours before you clean 
and disinfect. If it is not possible to wait 24 hours, wait as long as 
practicable. Ensure a safe and correct application of disinfectants using 
personal protective equipment and ventilation recommended for 
cleaning. Keep disinfectant products away from students. 
 Advise sick staff members and students not to return until they have met 
CDC criteria to discontinue home isolation, including at least 3 days with 
no fever, symptoms have improved and at least 10 days since symptoms 
first appeared. 
 Ensure that students, including students with disabilities, have access to 
instruction when out of class, as required by federal and state law. 
 Schools should offer distance learning based on the unique 
circumstances of each student who would be put at-risk by an in-person 
instructional model. For example, students with a health condition, 
students with family members with a health condition, students who 
cohabitate or regularly interact with high-risk individuals, or are otherwise 
identified as “at-risk” by the parents or guardian, are students whose 
circumstances merit coffering distances learning. 
----------------Page (16) Break----------------
 
 Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a school has an 
outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
 Investigate the COVID-19 illness and exposures and determine if any 
work-related factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update 
protocols as needed to prevent further cases.  
 Update protocols as needed to prevent further cases. See the CDPH 
guidelines, Responding to COVID-19 in the Workplace, which are 
incorporated into this guidance and contain detailed recommendations 
for establishing a plan to identify cases, communicating with workers 
and other exposed persons, and conducting and assisting with contact 
tracing. 
 
11.  Maintain Healthy Operations 
 Monitor staff absenteeism and have a roster of trained back-up staff 
where available. 
 Monitor the types of illnesses and symptoms among your students and 
staff to help isolate them promptly as needed. 
 Designate a staff liaison or liaisons to be responsible for responding to 
COVID-19 concerns. Workers should know who they are and how to 
contact them. The liaison should be trained to coordinate the 
documentation and tracking of possible exposure, in order to notify local 
health officials, staff and families in a prompt and responsible manner. 
 Maintain communication systems that allow staff and families to self- 
report symptoms and receive prompt notifications of exposures and 
closures, while maintaining confidentiality, as required by FERPA and state 
law related to privacy of educational records. Additional guidance can 
be found here. 
 Consult with local health departments if routine testing is being 
considered by a local educational agency. The role of providing routine 
systematic testing of staff or students for COVID-19 (e.g., PCR swab testing 
for acute infection, or presence of antibodies in serum after infection) is 
currently unclear. 
 Support students who are at higher risk for severe illness or who cannot 
safely distance from household contacts at higher risk, by providing 
options such as virtual learning or independent study.

12. Considerations for Reopening and Partial or 
Total Closures 
California schools have been closed for in-person instruction since mid-March 
2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. School closures to in-person instruction 
were part of a broader set of recommendations intended to reduce 
transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. For more detailed 
direction on measures to be taken when a student, teacher, or staff member 
has symptoms or is diagnosed with COVID-19, please see the COVID-19 and 
Reopening Framework for K-12 Schools in California. 
 Check State and local orders and health department notices daily 
about transmission in the area or closures and adjust operations 
accordingly. 
 When a student, teacher or staff member tests positive for COVID-19 
and had exposed others at the school, refer to the CDPH Framework for 
K-12 Schools, and implement the following steps: 
o In consultation with the local public health department, the 
appropriate school official should ensure cleaning and quarantine of 
exposed persons and whether any additional intervention is 
warranted, including the length of time necessary, based on the risk 
level within the specific community as determined by the local 
public health officer. 
o Close off the classroom or office where the patient was based and 
do not use these areas until after cleaning and disinfection. Wait at 
least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting. If 24 hours is not 
feasible, wait for at least two hours and as long as possible.  
o Additional areas of the school visited by the COVID-19 positive 
individual may also need to be cleaned and disinfected. 
o Implement communication plans for exposure at school and 
potential school closures to include outreach to students, 
parents, teachers, staff and the community. 
o Include information for staff regarding labor laws, information 
regarding Disability Insurance, Paid Family Leave and 
Unemployment Insurance, as applicable to schools. See additional 
information on government programs supporting sick leave and 
worker’s compensation for COVID-19, including worker’s sick leave 
rights under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and 
employee’s rights to workers’ compensation benefits and 
presumption of the work-relatedness of COVID-19 pursuant to the 
Governor’s Executive Order N-62-20, while that Order is in effect. 
o Provide guidance to parents, teachers and staff reminding them of 
----------------Page (18) Break----------------
 
the importance of community physical distancing measures while 
a school is closed, including discouraging students or staff from 
gathering elsewhere. 
o Develop a plan for continuity of education. Consider in that plan how 
to also continue nutrition and other services provided in the regular 
school setting to establish alternate mechanisms for these services to 
continue. 
o Maintain regular communications with the local public 
health department.
