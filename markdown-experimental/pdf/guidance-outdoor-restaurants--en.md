OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that 
person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or occupational 
groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at this time. There 
have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that workers are at risk 
of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these workplaces include 
hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, warehouses, meat processing 
plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not required) and
customers/clients,
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new cases 
of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and work with 
public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for restaurants providing outdoor dining, takeout, 
drive-through pick-up, and/or delivered meals to support a safe, clean environment for 
workers and customers. The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker 
rights, either statutory, regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it 
does not include county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and 
health-related regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on
changes to public health guidance and state/local orders as the COVID-19 situation 
continues. Cal/OSHA has more comprehensive guidance on their Cal/OSHA General 
Guidelines on Protecting Workers from COVID-19 webpage. The U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration has guidance for restaurants and the CDC has additional requirements in 
their guidance for businesses and employers.

•Restaurants should be closed for indoor dining and should only be open to outdoor
seated dining, drive-through, or other pick-up/delivery options. Indoor dining
service at restaurants, brewpubs, breweries, pubs, craft distilleries, and wineries in
counties whose health officer has approved further reopening may follow
additional guidance on the COVID-19 County Roadmap website.
•Restaurants providing outdoor dining, takeout, drive-through pick-up, and
delivered meals may only sell alcohol when purchased in the same transaction as
a meal.
•Restaurants providing delivery should follow the guidance for delivery services.
•Operations that are currently authorized to provide off sale beer, wine, and spirits
to be consumed off premises should follow the guidance for retail operations and
offer curbside sales only, until local and/or statewide rules allow additional retail
activity.
•Producers of beer, wine, and spirits should follow the guidance for manufacturing
operations.
•This guidance is not intended for concert, performance, or entertainment venues.
Those types of establishments should remain closed until they are allowed to
resume modified or full operation through a specific reopening order or guidance.
Establishments that serve full meals must discontinue this type of entertainment until
these types of activities are allowed to resume modified or full operation.
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly requires 
the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all public and 
workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, whether 
at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution
to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance;

•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or private
car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no
passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be found 
in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other circumstances, and 
employers can implement additional face covering requirements in fulfilling their 
obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. Employers must 
provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the reasonable cost of 
obtaining them. 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one of 
the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot wear 
one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if feasible, 
and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to wearing 
face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude any member 
of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying with the 
guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these exemptions among 
customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Workplace Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every 
location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and 
work tasks, and designate a person at each establishment to implement 
the plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
restaurant is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers or customers. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the establishment for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related factors 
could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as needed to 
prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has 
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an infected 
worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) and close 
contacts. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
Topics for Worker Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to 
contracting the virus. 
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks 
using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work: 
o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, such 
as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,

fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, 
sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, 
OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR 
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone 
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered potentially 
infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 10 
days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms have 
improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of fever 
reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without symptoms 
who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only if 10 days have 
passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 test. 
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including 
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 60% 
ethanol or 70% isopropanol when workers cannot get to a sink or 
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time (see 
Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not 
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or discarded 
after each shift. 
• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings

must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and 
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. 
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who 
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled. 
• Ensure any independent contractors, temporary or contract workers, and 
volunteers at the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention 
policies and have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities 
ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract 
workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive 
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional 
information on government programssupporting sick leave and worker’s 
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under 
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the Governor’s Executive 
Order N-51-20, and workers’ rights to workers’ compensation benefits and 
presumption of the work-relatedness of COVID-19 pursuant to the 
Governor’s Executive order N-62-20 while that Order is in effect. 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers 
entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom 
screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible. 
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to 
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed 
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC 
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. 
• Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to 
stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including face coverings and gloves where necessary. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to 
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are 
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly 
touched items. Workers should wear gloves when handling items 
contaminated by body fluids. 
• Servers, bussers, and other workers moving items used by customers (dirty 
cups, plates, napkins, etc.) or handling trash bags should use disposable 
gloves (and wash hands before putting them on and after removing

them) and provide aprons and change frequently. 
• Dishwashers should use equipment to protect the eyes, nose, and mouth 
from contaminant splash using protective glasses, goggles, or a face 
shield in addition to a face covering. Dishwashers must be provided 
impermeable aprons and change frequently. Reusable protective 
equipment such as shields and glasses should be properly disinfected 
between uses. 
• Establishments must take reasonable measures, including posting signage 
at all entrances and in strategic and highly-visible locations and in 
reservation confirmations, to remind the public that they must use face 
coverings while not eating and drinking and practice physical distancing 
and that they should frequently wash their hands with soap for at least 20 
seconds, use hand sanitizer, and not touch their face. 
• Remind guests in advance to bring a face covering and make them 
available to anyone who arrives without one, if possible. 
• Guests and visitors should be screened for temperature and/or 
symptoms upon arrival, asked to use hand sanitizer, and to wear a face 
covering when not eating or drinking. Employers have the right to 
cancel reservations for individuals/parties with symptomatic guests. 
• Display a set of clearly visible rules for customers and restaurant 
personnel at the restaurant entrance(s) that are to be a condition of 
entry. The rules could include instructions to use hand sanitizer, maintain 
physical distance from other customers, avoid unnecessary touching of 
restaurant surfaces, contact information for the local health 
department, and changes to restaurant services. Whenever possible, 
the rules should be available digitally, include pictograms, and included 
on/with menus. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas, such as waiting areas, 
break rooms, lunch areas, and areas of ingress and egress including host 
stands, entry ways, stairways, stairwells, escalators, handrails, and elevator 
controls. Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces including doors, 
door handles, crash bars, light switches, credit card terminals, ATM PIN 
pads, receipt trays, bus tubs, serving trays, phones, toilets, and 
handwashing facilities. 
• Frequently clean items touched by patrons, especially those that might 
attract contact from children including candy and toy vending machines, 
decorative fish tanks, display cases, decorative fountains, etc.

• Clean touchable surfaces between shifts or between users, whichever is 
more frequent, including but not limited to working surfaces, phones, 
registers, touchpads/touchscreens, tablets, time clocks, appliances, 
kitchen and bar utensils and implements, oven doors, grill and range knobs, 
carts and trolleys, keys, etc. 
• Avoid sharing audio equipment, phones, tablets, laptops, desks, pens, and 
other work supplies wherever possible. Never share PPE. 
• Discontinue shared use of audio headsets and other equipment between 
workers unless the equipment can be properly disinfected after use. 
Consult equipment manufacturers to determine appropriate disinfection 
steps, particularly for soft, porous surfaces such as foam earmuffs. 
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift. 
Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as part of 
the workers’ job duties. 
• Procure options for third-party cleaning companies to assist with the 
increased cleaning demand, as needed. 
• Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times and 
provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when needed. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use products 
approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. Use 
disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, 
diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or 
alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the 
surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer’s 
directions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe 
use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should wear gloves as required 
by the product instructions and ensure proper ventilation. 
• Continue to follow existing codes regarding requirements for sanitizing 
(rather than disinfecting) food contact surfaces. 
• To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated 
with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features are safe 
to use after a prolonged facility shutdown. 
• Restaurants should increase fresh air circulation by opening windows or 
doors, if possible and in accordance with security and safety protocols. 
• Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that can 
disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever 
possible. 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the

building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other 
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in all 
working areas. 
• Provide disposable menus to guests and make menus available digitally so 
that customers can view on a personal electronic device, if possible. If 
disposable menus cannot be provided, properly disinfect menus before 
and after customer use. Consider options for customers to order ahead of 
time. 
• Discontinue pre-setting tables with napkins, cutlery, glassware, food ware, 
etc. These should be supplied individually to customers as needed. Do not 
leave card stands, flyers, napkin holders, or other items on tables. 
• Suspend use of shared food items such as condiment bottles, salt and 
pepper shakers, etc. and provide these foods in single serve containers, if 
possible. Where this is not possible, shared items such as condiment bottles, 
shakers, etc., should be supplied as needed to customers and disinfected 
after each use. 
• Pre-roll utensils in napkins prior to use by customers. Workers must wash 
hands before pre-rolling utensils in napkins. The pre-roll should then be 
stored in a clean container. After customers are seated, the pre-roll should 
be put on the table by a worker who recently washed their hands. 
• Reusable customer items including utensils, food ware, breadbaskets, etc., 
must be properly washed, rinsed, and sanitized. Cleaned flatware, 
stemware, dishware, etc., must be properly stored away from customers 
and personnel until ready for use. Use disposable items if proper cleaning of 
reusable items is infeasible. 
• Takeout containers must be filled by customers and available only upon 
request. 
• Dirty linens used at dining tables such as tablecloths and napkins should be 
removed after each customer use and transported from dining areas in 
sealed bags. Workers should wear gloves when handling dirtylinens. 
• Thoroughly clean each customer dining location after every use. This will 
include disinfecting tables, chairs, booster seats, highchairs, booths, etc. 
and allowing adequate time for proper disinfection, following product 
instructions. Many EPA-approved disinfectants require minimal contact 
time (seconds to one minute) against human coronavirus. 
• Consider using disposable seat covers, particularly on porous surfaces. 
Discard and replace seat covers between each use. Provide disposable or 
washable covers on pillows used in seating areas and change/wash them 
after each use.

• Close areas where customers may congregate or touch food or food ware 
items that other guests may use. Modify delivery of these items by providing 
items to guests individually, converting to cafeteria-style service, etc. 
Discard or clean, disinfect, or sanitize shared items after each use, as 
appropriate. The areas that should be closed include but are not limited to: 
o Self-service areas with condiment caddies, utensil caddies, napkins, 
lids, straws, water pitchers, to-go containers, etc. 
o Self-service machines including ice, soda, frozen yogurtdispensers, 
etc. 
o Self-service food areas such as buffets, salsa bars, salad bars, etc. 
• Discontinue tableside food preparation and presentation such as food item 
selection carts and conveyor belts, guacamole preparation, etc. 
• Do not leave out after-meal mints, candies, snacks, or toothpicks for 
customers. Offer them with the check or provide only on request. 
• Install hand sanitizer dispensers, touchless if possible, at guest and worker 
entrances and contact areas such as driveways, reception areas, in dining 
rooms, near elevator landings, etc. 
• Discontinue use of shared entertainment items such as board games, pool 
tables, arcade games, vending machines, etc. Close game and 
entertainment areas where customers may share items such as bowling 
alleys, etc. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Restaurants providing takeout and/or delivery should use online, phone, or 
other remote ordering systems to minimize the amount of time workers 
physically interact with customers. If possible, ask customers to wait outside 
and bring to-go items outside to customers. Use visual cues and/or markers 
so that customers, delivery drivers, and workers can maintain at least six 
feet of physical distance when transferring items. 
• Restaurants providing outdoor dining service can expand their outdoor 
seating, and alcohol offerings in those areas, if they comply with local laws 
and regulations. 
• Encourage reservations to allow for time to disinfect restaurant areas and 
provide guidance via digital platforms, if possible, to customers for physical 
distancing while at the restaurant. 
• Consider allowing outdoor, dine-in customers to order ahead of time to 
limit the amount of time spent at the establishment. Ask customers to wait 
in their cars or away from the establishment while waiting to be seated. If

possible, alert patrons through their mobile phones when their table is ready 
to avoid touching and use of “buzzers.” 
• Limit the number of patrons at a single table to a household unit or patrons 
who have asked to be seated together. People in the same party seated 
at the same table do not have to be six feet apart. All members of the 
party must be present before seating and hosts must bring the entire party 
to the table at one time. 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between workers and customers. This can include use of physical partitions 
or visual cues (e.g., floor markings or signs to indicate to where workers 
and/or guests should stand). 
• Reconfigure restaurant locations, such as host stands, etc., to be outdoors, 
if possible and in accordance with security and safety protocols. If these 
activities must remain indoors, install physical barriers or partitions at cash 
registers, bars, host stands, and other areas where maintaining physical 
distance of six feet is difficult. 
• Any area where guests or workers queue should also be clearly marked for 
appropriate physical distancing. This includes check-stands and terminals, 
counters and lines, restrooms, elevator lobbies, and any other area where 
customers wait and/or congregate. 
• Physical distancing protocols should be used in any office areas, kitchens, 
pantries, walk-in freezers, or other high-density, high-traffic work areas, 
where possible. 
• Worker pre-shift meetings and trainings should be conducted virtually or in 
areas that allow for appropriate physical distancing between workers. 
Food, beverages, food ware, etc., must not be shared. 
• Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to 
maintain physical distancing protocols. 
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., managing 
inventory rather than working as a cashier or managing administrative 
needs through telework). 
• Reconfigure office spaces, kitchens, workstations, and other spaces 
wherever possible to allow for at least six feet of distance between people 
passing through areas for entry and exit. 
• Remove tables and chairs from dining areas so that six feet of physical 
distance can be maintained for customers and workers. If tables, chairs, 
benches, etc., cannot be moved, use visual cues to show that they are not 
available for use or install Plexiglas or other types of impermeable physical 
barriers to minimize exposure between customers.

• Discontinue seating guests where they cannot maintain six feet of distance 
from workers, work areas, and food and drink preparation areas. 
• Limit the number of workers serving individual parties, in compliance with 
wage and hour regulations. 
• All restaurant workers should minimize the amount of time spent within six 
feet of guests. 
• Close breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance between tables/chairs 
to separate workers and discourage congregating during breaks. Where 
possible, create outdoor break areas with shade covers and seating that 
ensures physical distancing. 
• Reconfigure kitchens to maintain physical distancing in those areas where 
practical and, if not practical, stagger shifts, if possible, to do work ahead 
of time. 
• Discourage food preparation workers from changing or entering others’ 
workstations during shifts. 
• Discourage people from congregating in high traffic areas such as 
bathrooms, hallways, bar areas, credit card terminals, etc. 
• Establish directional hallways and passageways for foot traffic, if possible, to 
eliminate people from passing by one another. 
• Require workers to avoid handshakes and similar greetings that break 
physical distance. 
• Guests should enter through doors that are propped open or automated, if 
possible. Hand sanitizer should be available for guests who must touch door 
handles. 
• Adjust music volume so that workers can maintain distance from customers 
to hear orders. 
• Workers should not open the doors of cars or taxis. 
• Avoid touching others’ pens and clipboards. If possible, install transfer-
aiding materials, such as shelving and bulletin boards, to reduce person-
to-person hand-offs. 
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Employers must 
comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as 
guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California 
Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers should be prepared to alter their 
operations as those guidelines change.
