GUIDANCE: 
Hotels, Lodging, and 
Short Term Rentals 
July 29, 2020 
All guidance should be implemented 
only with county health officer approval 
following their review of local 
epidemiological data including cases 
per 100,000 population, rate of test 
positivity, and local preparedness to 
support a health care surge, vulnerable 
populations, contact tracing, and 
testing. 1

OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that 
person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not
required) and customers,
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention
plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for the hotel, lodging, and short term rentals industries 
to support a safe, clean environment for workers and customers. 
NOTE: Hotel, lodging, and short-term rental operations with large meeting venues, 
banquet halls, or convention centers should keep those areas closed until each 
of those types of establishments are allowed to resume modified or full operation. 
Property managers, timeshare operators, and other rental unit owners and 
operators must only rent unoccupied units and cannot rent rooms or spaces 
within an occupied residence until otherwise notified. A residence or unit that is

rented while the operator is not physically present, or has a separate exterior entrance 
and exit that does not require the use of shared facilities, and is otherwise unoccupied, 
should be considered an unoccupied unit. When allowed to reopen to modified or full 
operation, operators should refer to guidance on such industries as it becomes available 
on the COVID-19 Resilience Roadmap website. Additional guidance relevant for hotel 
and lodging operations, including dine-in restaurants, bars, fitness centers, family 
entertainment centers, hair salons, and retail operations, is available on the COVID-19 
Resilience Roadmap website. 
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public 
health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA 
has more safety and health guidance on their Cal/OSHA Guidance on Requirements to 
Protect Workers from Coronavirus webpage. CDC has additional guidance for 
businesses and employers. 
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, whether 
at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution
to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance; or,
•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or private
car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no
passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other circumstances, 
and employers can implement additional face covering requirements in fulfilling their 
3

obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. Employers must 
provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the reasonable cost of 
obtaining them. 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one of 
the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot wear 
one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if feasible, 
and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to wearing 
face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude any 
member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying with 
the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these exemptions 
among customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Workplace Specific Plan 
• Establish  a  written,  workplace-specific  COVID-19  prevention  plan  at 
every facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas 
and work tasks, and designate a person at each facility to implement 
the plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
facility is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers or guests. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the workplace for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan 
as needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a 
workplace has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive 
worker(s) and close contacts. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
Topics for Worker Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to 
contracting the virus. 
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks 
using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work: 
o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, such 
as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,

fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, 
sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, 
OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR 
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone 
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered potentially 
infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 10 
days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms have 
improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of fever 
reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without symptoms 
who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only if 10 days have 
passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 test. 
• To  seek  medical  attention  if  their  symptoms  become  severe,  including 
persistent  pain  or  pressure  in  the  chest,  confusion,  or  bluish  lips  or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including 
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least 
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible 
to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or 
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time (see 
Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not 
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or discarded 
after each shift. 
• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings

must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and 
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. 
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who 
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled. 
• Ensure any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at 
the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and 
have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of 
time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive 
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional 
information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers’ 
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under 
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the Governor’s Executive 
Order N-51-20, and workers’ rights to workers’ compensation benefits and 
presumption of the work-relatedness of COVID-19 pursuant to the 
Governor’s Executive Order N-62-20 while that Order is in effect. 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors or contractors entering the 
establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom screener avoids close 
contact with workers to the extent possible. 
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to 
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed 
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC 
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. 
• Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to 
stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. 
• Employers  should  consider  where  disposable  glove  use  may  be  helpful  to 
supplement  frequent  handwashing or use  of hand  sanitizer; examples  are 
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly 
touched items. 
• Housekeeping must only service rooms when guests are not present. 
Housekeepers should be instructed to minimize contact with guests’ 
personal belongings when cleaning. Housekeepers should be instructed to 
have ventilation systems operating and/or open windows whenever 
possible to increase air circulation.

• Employers should encourage handwashing, with soap and water, and/or 
using proper hand sanitizer for workers after interactions with guests, 
cleaning rooms, and opening mail or handle other commonly touched 
items. Valet service drivers, baggage handlers, and housekeepers should 
wash their hands regularly during their shift and/or use proper hand 
sanitizer. 
• If possible, baggage deliveries should be done when guests are not in their 
rooms. 
• Hotel, lodging, and short-term rental operations should take steps to ensure 
guests are fully aware of the facility’s new policies and procedures prior to their 
arrival. Recommended policies and procedures include that the hotel or lodging 
operator has the right to cancel reservations for parties with symptomatic visitors 
and that there are new check-in procedures, physical distancing requirements, 
and cleaning and disinfecting schedules for accommodations, amenities, and 
common areas like the check-in/registration area. 
• Guests and visitors should be temperature and/or screened upon arrival 
and asked to use hand sanitizer and to wear a face covering. Face 
coverings should be provided to guests who arrive without them, if feasible. 
Appropriate signage should also be prominently displayed outlining proper 
face covering usage and current physical distancing practices in use 
throughout the property. 
• Remind guests in advance to bring a face covering and make them 
available to anyone who arrives without one, if possible. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas such as hotel lobbies, front 
desk check-in counters, bell desks, break rooms and lunch areas, 
changing areas, loading docks, kitchens, and areas of ingress and egress 
including stairways, stairwells, handrails, and elevator controls. 
• Disinfect commonly used surfaces throughout the day and evening, 
including door handles, vending and ice machines, light switches, phones, 
washer and dryer doors and controls, baggage carts, shuttle door 
handles, toilets, and handwashing facilities. Disinfect surfaces during daily 
room cleanings. Clean dirty items before disinfecting. 
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift. 
Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as part of 
the worker’s job duties. 
• Equip workstations, desks, and help counters with proper sanitation 
products, including hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes, and provide 
personal hand sanitizers to all worker directly assisting customers.

• Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times and 
provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when needed. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use products 
approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. Use 
disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, 
diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water),or 
alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the 
surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer’s 
directions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe 
use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should wear gloves and other 
protective equipment as required by the product instructions. Follow the 
asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended by the California 
Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation. 
• Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that 
can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter 
wherever possible. 
• To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated 
with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g., 
drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged 
facility shutdown. 
• Avoid sharing phones, tablets, laptops, desks, pens, other work supplies, or 
offices wherever possible. Never share PPE. Any shared tools and 
equipment should be cleaned and disinfected before, during and after 
each shift or anytime the equipment is transferred to a new worker. This 
includes phones, radios, computers and other communication devices, 
payment terminals, kitchen implements, engineering tools,safety buttons, 
folios, housekeeping carts and cleaning equipment, keys, time clocks, and 
all other direct contact items. 
• Discontinue the use of shared food and beverage equipment in office 
pantries (including shared coffee brewers). Close manually operated ice 
machines or use hands-free machines. 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the 
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other 
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in 
offices, guest rooms, and other spaces.

Additional Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
for Hotel Operations 
• All reusable collateral, such as magazines, menus, local attraction details, 
coupons, etc., should be removed from guest rooms. Critical information 
should be provided as single-use collateral and/or electronically posted. 
• Kitchen items, including pots, pans, and utensils, must be cleaned 
between each guest stay. All dishes must be washed, including the ones 
in the cabinet and others that may have been left in different rooms. 
Provide adequate dish soap and new, unused sponges for each guest 
upon arrival. Consider replacing utensils with one-time use dinnerware, if 
feasible. 
• Properly clean all appliances and kitchen areas, including refrigerator 
shelving, the oven stovetop, coffee-makers, toasters, pantry shelves, 
and other areas. 
• Dirty linens should be removed and transported from guest rooms in 
single-use, sealed bags. Removal and cleaning of all towels and linens at 
the conclusion of each guest stay should include all items, regardless of 
whether they appear to have been used or not. These items should be 
bagged in the guest room to eliminate excess contact while being 
transported. All bed linen and laundry should be washed at a high 
temperature and cleaned in accordance with CDC guidelines. 
• Consider leaving rooms vacant for 24 to 72 hours after a guest has 
departed, if feasible. 
• In the event of a presumptive case of COVID-19, the guest’s room should 
be removed from service and quarantined. The guest room should not be 
returned to service until case has been confirmed or cleared. In the 
event of a positive case, the room should only be returned to service 
after undergoing an enhanced disinfection protocol in accordance with 
CDC guidelines. 
• Install hand sanitizer dispensers, touchless whenever possible, at key guest 
and worker entrances and contact areas such as driveways, reception 
areas, hotel lobbies, restaurant entrances, meeting and convention 
spaces, elevator landings, pools, salons and exercise areas.

Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between and among workers, guests, and the public. These can include 
use of physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings or signs to 
indicate to where workers and/or guests should stand). Any area where 
guests or workers queue should be clearly marked for appropriate physical 
distancing. This includes check-in, check-out, elevator lobbies, coffee 
shops and dining, and taxi and ridesharing lines. 
• Physical distancing protocols should be used in worker break areas, uniform 
control areas, training classrooms, shared office spaces, the worker 
services window (via a teller style window), and other high-density areas in 
order to ensure appropriate distancing between workers. 
• Pre-shift meetings should be conducted virtually or in areas that allow for 
appropriate physical distancing between workers. Larger departments 
should stagger arrival times to minimize traffic volume in back of house 
corridors and service elevators. 
• Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to 
maintain physical distancing protocols. 
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., managing 
inventory rather than working at the concierge desk or managing 
administrative needs through telework). 
• Close breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance between tables/chairs 
to separate workers and discourage congregating during breaks. Where 
possible, create outdoor break areas with shade covers and seating that 
ensures physical distancing. 
• Redesign office spaces, cubicles, lobbies, front desk check-in areas, 
business centers, concierge service areas, and other spaces to ensure 
workspaces and guest accommodations allow for at least six feet 
distancing. 
• Discourage workers from congregating in high traffic areas such as 
bathrooms and hallways and establish directional hallways and 
passageways for foot traffic, if possible, to eliminate people from passing 
by one another. 
• Limit the number of individuals riding in an elevator. Use signage to 
communicate these requirements. 
• Require workers  to  avoid  handshakes  and  similar  greetings  that break 
physical distance.

• Eliminate person-to-person contact for delivery of goods to physical offices. 
Avoid touching others’ pens and clipboards. 
Additional Physical Distancing Guidelines for 
Hotel Operations 
• Guests should enter through doors that are either propped open, if possible 
and in adherence to security protocols, or are automated or manually 
operated by a worker who is frequently handwashing and/or using proper 
hand sanitizer. 
• Implement  peak  period  queueing  procedures,  including  a  lobby greeter 
and  having  guests  queue  outside  to  maintain  at  least  six  feet  of  physical 
distance between persons. 
• Workers should not open the doors of cars or taxis. 
• Guest room service, laundry and dry-cleaning services, and amenity 
deliveries should be made available using contactless pick-up and delivery 
protocols wherever possible. 
• Hotel and lodging operations with golf courses should only allow one 
player per cart, except for immediate family and people who cohabitate, 
and increase tee time spacing, and should only open once golf courses 
are allowed to reopen. Additional guidance on outdoor recreation is 
available on the COVID-19 Resilience Roadmap website. 
Additional Considerations for Short-Term Rental 
Units 
• Property managers, timeshare operators, and other rental unit owners and 
operators must only rent unoccupied units and cannot rent rooms or 
spaces within an occupied residence until otherwise notified. A residence 
or unit that is rented while the operator is not physically present, or has a 
separate exterior entrance and exit that does not require the use of shared 
facilities, and is otherwise unoccupied, should be considered an 
unoccupied unit. It can be very difficult to maintain proper cleaning and 
disinfecting protocols when residents, tenants, and guests from different 
households share common items like kitchen appliances, laundry facilities, 
etc. Shared, temporary housing also presents challenges with physical 
distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. 
• Property managers, timeshare operators, and other rental unit owners and 
operators should offer self or remote check-in and checkout, where 
possible. Consider installing a key lockbox or smart lock with a keypad, and

provide renters the appropriate self check-in instructions. 
• If  possible,  implement  standard  check-in  and  checkout  times,  and  avoid 
early  arrivals  or  late departures  to  minimize  the  possibility  of  disrupting  the 
enhanced cleaning process between guest stays. 
• Appropriate signage should be prominently displayed at the property 
entrance and other strategic locations on the property outlining proper 
face covering usage and current physical distancing practices in use 
throughout the property. 
• Take the proper steps to thoroughly clean and disinfect the rental unit after 
each guest stay. This includes wiping down and cleaning and disinfecting 
all high-touch areas, including bed rails, tables, TV remotes, headboards, 
countertops, kitchen appliances, refrigerator handles, stove knobs, mirrors, 
and other items. 
• Remove all leftover recycling, garbage, and trash from the rental unit. Line 
all the garbage cans, which will make it easier to dispose of tissues and 
other waste. Empty any food items the previous guest may have left in the 
refrigerator, freezer, and pantry. 
• All linens must be removed and laundered between each guest stay, 
including items that appear to not have been used. When cleaning 
bedding, towels, or other laundered items in rental units, wear disposable 
gloves when handling dirty laundry and discard them after each use. Wash 
hands with soap or use hand sanitizer immediately after gloves are 
removed. Do not store extra linens or in the rental unit. Provide such items 
only on request. 
• Do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus 
through the air. Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Launder items using the warmest appropriate 
water setting for the items and dry items completely. Clean and disinfect 
laundry hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. If possible, 
consider placing a bag liner that is either disposable and thrown away 
after each use or can be laundered after each use. 
• Clean all soft surfaces based on the manufacturer’s instructions, as 
appropriate. Remove visible dirt and grime and then clean with the 
appropriate cleaner for the material. If possible, machine-wash items 
according to the manufacturer’s directions. 
• Kitchen items, including pots, pans, and utensils, must be cleaned between 
each guest stay. All dishes must be washed, including the ones in the 
cabinet and others that may have been left in different rooms. Provide 
adequate dish soap and new, unused sponges for each guest upon 
arrival. Consider replacing utensils with one-time use dinnerware, if feasible.

• After each guest stay, properly clean all appliances and kitchen areas, 
including refrigerator shelving, the oven stovetop, coffee-makers, toasters, 
pantry shelves, and other areas. 
• Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that can 
disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever 
possible. 
• Bathroom toilets, showers, bathtubs, sinks, cabinets, and shelving should be 
disinfected with a multi-surface cleaner approved for use against COVID-
19 by the EPA. Mirrors and any glass should be properly wiped down. The 
bathroom floor should also be vacuumed and/or mopped. 
• Equip the rental unit with additional hand soap, paper towels, toilet paper, 
disinfecting spray or wipes, and hand sanitizer. 
• If using an external or professional cleaning company, communicate 
expectations and plans for cleaning and disinfection standards, and get 
periodic confirmation that they are being followed by the contracted 
company. 
• Communicate with guests on the cleaning and safety measures 
implemented, both pre-stay and during stay, via the listing content and 
property information booklet. Ensure guests understand all check-in and 
checkout protocols and any updated building or amenity policies (e.g. 
changes to services in apartment buildings). 
• Service requests should be considered with regard for the safety of 
maintenance providers and guests. To limit exposure, defer nonessential 
maintenance while the rental unit is occupied and handle only emergency 
or urgent issues as allowed by applicable law where possible. 
• Ensure that any HVAC/air filters have been replaced per the manufacturer’s 
directions. Consider whether more regular replacement of the filters is necessary. 
Use high filtration efficiency filters. Do not touch the surface of used air filters and 
remove and dispose of them with minimal disturbance using disposable gloves. 
• Consider leaving the rental vacant for 24 to 72 hours after a guest has 
departed, if feasible. 
• Any rental unit intended for large gatherings, including conferences or 
meetings, should not be opened until such operations can resume.

Additional Considerations for Swimming Pools 
and Aquatic Venues 
• Hotel, lodging, and short-term rental operations with swimming pools and 
splash pads should take additional steps to ensure those facilities are 
properly cleaned and disinfected for visitor use, according to CDC 
guidelines. 
• Hotel or lodging operators that have swimming pools which include water 
slides, water rides, or other water attractions must keep those areas closed 
until such operations can resume. Swimming pools themselves can remain 
open. 
• Please note that saunas, steam rooms, and hot tubs should remain closed 
until such operations can resume. 
• For indoor pools, face coverings must be worn when out of the water or 
shower areas, unless exempt from the CDPH guidance. Cloth face 
coverings can be difficult to breathe through when they are wet. Face 
coverings should be put away when not in use so they are not accidentally 
touched or picked up by others. 
• For outdoor pools, face coverings must be worn when out of the water 
whenever six-foot physical distancing cannot be maintained, unless 
exempt under the CDPH guidance. 
• Maintain proper disinfectant levels (1-10 parts per million free chlorine or 3-
8 ppm bromine) and pH (7.2-8). 
• Consult with the company or engineer that designed the aquatic venue to 
decide which List N disinfectants approved by the EPA are best for the 
aquatic venue. Ensure the safe and correct use and storage of 
disinfectants, including storing products securely away from children. 
• Set up a system so that furniture and equipment (e.g., lounge chairs) that 
needs to be cleaned and disinfected is kept separate from furniture that 
has already been cleaned and disinfected. Label containers for used 
equipment that has not yet been cleaned and disinfected and containers 
for cleaned and disinfected equipment. 
• Launder towels and clothing according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Use the warmest appropriate water temperature and dry items 
completely. Handle towels with disposable gloves and minimal 
disturbance, i.e., do not shake them. 
• Discourage people from sharing items, particularly those that are difficult to 
clean and disinfect or those that are meant to come in contact with the 
face (e.g., goggles, nose clips, and snorkels).

• Ensure that the facility has adequate equipment for guests, such as kick 
boards, pool noodles, and other flotation devices, to minimize sharing 
wherever possible. Clean and disinfect the items after each use. 
• For indoor aquatic venues, introduce and circulate outdoor air as much as 
possible by opening windows and doors, using fans, or other methods. 
However, do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety risk to 
workers, visitors, or swimmers. 
• Change the deck layout and other areas surrounding the pool to ensure 
that the standing and seating areas can support physical distancing 
requirements. This could include removing lounge chairs or taping off areas 
to discourage use. 
• Provide physical cues or guides (e.g., lane lines in the water or chairs and 
tables on the deck) and visual cues (e.g., tape on the decks, floors, or 
sidewalks) and signs to ensure that workers, visitors, and swimmers stay at 
least six feet apart from one another, both in and out of the water. 
• Where feasible, install impermeable physical barriers such as Plexiglas 
where workers and patrons must interact and physical distancing isdifficult. 
• Consider implementing reservations for pool use or implementing other 
mechanisms to support at least of six feet of physical distancing. This could 
include reserving full-lanes for individual lap swimming and half-lanes for 
individual household use. 
• Ensure that lifeguards who are actively lifeguarding are not also expected 
to monitor handwashing, use of cloth face coverings, or physical 
distancing. Assign this monitoring responsibility to another worker. 
• Aquatic venues should avoid activities that promote group gatherings and 
should be aware of local policies on gathering requirements to determine 
if aquatic fitness classes, swim lessons, swim team practices, swim meets, or 
pool parties can be held. 
• CDC’s Model Aquatic Health Code has more recommendations to 
prevent illness and injuries at public pools. 
1 Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. The hotel, lodging, 
and short term rental industries must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to 
adhere to its guidance as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers should 
be prepared to alter their operations as those guidelines change.
