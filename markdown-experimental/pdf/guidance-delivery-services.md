OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that 
person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible, 
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not 
required) and customers/clients, 
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, 
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention 
plan. 
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for the delivery services industry to support a safe, 
clean environment for workers. 
NOTE: Additional guidelines are available for the logistics and warehouse industry, 
which may be relevant for some delivery operators, are available on the COVID-
19 Resilience Roadmap website. 
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related

regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA. 1 Stay current on changes to 
public health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. 
Cal/OSHA has more safety and health guidance on their Cal/OSHA Interim General 
Guidelines on Protecting Workers from COVID-19 webpage. CDC has additional 
guidance for businesses and employers. CDC also has specific guidance for Food and 
Grocery Pick-up and Delivery and Mail and Parcel Delivery. 
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution
to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance;
•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no
passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering requirements 
in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. 
Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the 
reasonable cost of obtaining them. 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one of 
the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot 
wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive

alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if 
feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude 
any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying 
with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these 
exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Workplace Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at 
every location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work 
areas and work tasks, and designate a person at each establishment to 
implement the plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
operation is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers or customers. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the establishment for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as 
needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace 
has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) 
and close contacts. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
Topics for Worker Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to 
contracting the virus. 
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks 
using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work: 
o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, 
such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty

breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of 
taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea, OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR 
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone 
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered 
potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 
10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms 
have improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of 
fever reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without 
symptoms who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only 
if 10 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 
test. 
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
• The   importance   of   frequent   handwashing   with   soap   and   water, 
including scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with 
at  least  60%  ethanol  (preferred)  or  70%  isopropanol  (if  the  product  is 
inaccessible to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink 
or handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time 
(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not 
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or discarded 
after each shift.

•Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings.
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled.
•Ensure any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers
at the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention
policies and have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these
responsibilities ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary
and/or contract workers.
•Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to
receive that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See
additional information on government programs supporting sick leave
and workers’ compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick
leave rights under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and
workers’ rights to workers’ compensation benefits and presumption of
the work-relatedness of COVID-19 pursuant to the
Governor’s Executive Order N-62-20 while that Order is in effect.
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
•For those delivery workers who first report at a facility prior to starting a
shift, provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at
the  beginning  of  their  shift. Make  sure  the  temperature/symptom
screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible.
•For delivery workers who do not report to a physical location prior to
starting their shift or if requiring self-screening at home, which is an
appropriate alternative to providing it at the establishment, ensure that
screening was performed prior to the worker leaving the home for their
shift and follows CDC guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker
Training section above.
•Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to
stay home.
•Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary.
•Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful
to supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples
are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling
commonly touched items.

Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
•Delivery facilities should perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas
such as break rooms, lunch areas, and areas of ingress and egress
including stairways and stairwells, handrails, and elevators controls.
Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces, including doorknobs, toilets,
and handwashing facilities.
•To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases
associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and
features are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown.
•When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use products
approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. Use
disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens,
diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water),
or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the
surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards,
manufacturer’s directions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA
requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should
wear gloves and other protective equipment as required by the product
instructions. Follow the asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended
by the California Department of Public Health and ensure proper
ventilation.
•Provide workers with an adequate supply of materials required to clean
and disinfect frequently touched surfaces of the delivery vehicle
(particularly if it is shared). Provide lined trash receptacles to be placed
in delivery vehicles to properly dispose of disinfectant wipes and other
items.
•Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their
shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as
part of the worker’s job duties.
•Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods
that can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA
filter wherever possible.
•The vehicle should be cleaned between delivery routes. This includes the
steering wheel, gearshift, signaling levers, seat adjustments, door handles,
controls, console, trunk/cargo area, etc. Provide time for workers to
implement cleaning practices before and after delivery routes. If
cleaning is assigned to the driver they must be compensated for that
time.

• For pooled/shared delivery vehicles, use protective barriers such as 
disposable mats and seat coverings. 
• Workers should inspect deliveries and take all necessary and feasible 
disinfection measures when receiving goods in warehouses andfacilities. 
• Where alternatives to physical contact with delivery-related items cannot 
be avoided, workers should wipe down and disinfect equipment, pens, 
clipboards, and electronic signature pads after each use when shared 
with customers while performing a delivery. Touch pads and punch keys 
on terminals such as card readers or handheld digital devices must be 
cleaned and disinfected after every transaction. 
• Workers should limit contact with frequently touched surfaces during 
deliveries, such as doorbells or door handles. If possible, avoid contact 
with hands or bare skin when opening doors. 
• Communicate to workers where they can access soap, clean running 
water, and drying materials, and provide alcohol-based hand 
sanitizers; adjust delivery schedules to build in time for frequent 
handwashing. 
• For delivery drivers, normally accessible restrooms on routes (e.g., 
restaurants, coffee shops) may be closed. Employers should provide 
workers alternative restroom locations and allow time for workers to use 
them. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between those workers loading and unloading goods at delivery 
facilities, and between delivery workers and customers and others at 
drop-off sites. 
• Implement “contactless” deliveries wherever possible. Contactless 
deliveries involve the delivery worker leaving a delivery at a doorstep, 
moving back to a distance of at least six feet away while verifying receipt 
of the delivery with the recipient (if required), and performing tasks 
electronically whenever possible (e.g., in an app or over a phone). 
• Update package delivery processes so that workers and customers can 
maintain physical distance when signing for packages and require 
delivery workers maintain a distance of at least six feet from others they 
might meet or need to speak to while making deliveries. 
• Avoid sharing scanners, pens, or other tools with customers. 
• Offer curbside delivery or pickup and move transaction receipts and

agreements to remote/digital platforms as feasible. 
• Consider suspending non-critical pre-shift, in-person meetings or convert 
them to virtual meetings or calls. If in-person meetings must be held, 
stagger meetings or hold them on locations that allow physical 
distancing. 
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., 
managing inventory rather than working as a cashier or managing 
administrative needs through telework). 
• Close breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance between 
tables/chairs to separate workers and discourage congregating during 
breaks. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade covers 
and seating that ensures physical distancing. 
• Provide messaging via handheld devices and mobile phones to remind 
workers to wear face coverings, maintain physical distance during 
delivery stops, and practice good hygiene. 
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. The delivery services 
industry must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards of and be prepared to adhere to its 
guidance as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and 
the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers should be prepared 
to alter their operations as those guidelines change.
