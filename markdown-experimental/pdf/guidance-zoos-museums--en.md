COVID-19 
INDUSTRY 
GUIDANCE: 
Museums, Galleries, 
Zoos, and Aquariums 
October 20, 2020 
This guidance is designed to address 
sectors and activities opening statewide. 
However, local health officers may 
implement more stringent rules tailored 
to local epidemiological conditions, so 
employers should also confirm relevant 
local opening policies.

OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at 
home to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that 
may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with 
serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at 
higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when 
people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, 
even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available 
at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating 
that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of 
these workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, restaurants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken 
to ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not required)
and guests/clients/visitors,
frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus.

PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for museums, galleries, botanical gardens, zoos, 
aquariums, and other similar spaces (referred to collectively as “museums”) to support 
a safe, clean environment for workers and customers. Businesses must identify and 
monitor the County Risk Level for the county the business is operating in and make 
required adjustments to their operations: 
•Purple – Widespread – Tier 1: Outdoor operations are permitted and must follow
the modifications in this guidance.
•Red – Substantial – Tier 2: Indoor operations are permitted but must be limited to
25% capacity and must follow the modifications in this guidance.
•Orange – Moderate – Tier 3: Indoor operations are permitted but must be limited
to 50% capacity and must follow the modifications in this guidance.
•Yellow – Minimal – Tier 4: Indoor operations are permitted at full capacity and
must follow the modifications in this guidance.
For the most updated information on county tier status, visit Blueprint for a Safer 
Economy. Please note that local health departments can have more restrictive criteria 
and different closures. Find your county’s local information.  
NOTE: Museums may have a number of operational aspects and service offerings 
available in other guidance on the Industry Guidance to Reduce Risk website. 
Operators must review and adhere to the modifications in the guidance. Such 
operations include: 
•Arcades or games (Family Entertainment Centers guidance)
•Restaurants, food service, and concessions (Restaurant guidance)
•Bars (Bars, Breweries, and Distilleries guidance)
•Gift shops and retail operations (Retail guidance)
•Janitorial or custodial services (Limited Services guidance)
•Outdoor playgrounds (see CDPH Outdoor Playground guidance)
Museums with convention space, rentable meeting rooms, other areas for private 
events, etc., should keep those areas closed until large gatherings are allowed to 
resume modified or full operation through a specific reopening order and guidance. 
Discontinue demonstrations, such as live animal shows, unless physical distancing and 
sanitation protocols can be ensured. All large events or gatherings, such as concerts 
or private parties/events, must be cancelled or postponed until such activities are 
permitted to resume. 
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to 
3
----------------Page (2) Break----------------
public health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. 
Cal/OSHA has more comprehensive guidance on their Cal/OSHA General Guidelines 
on Protecting Workers from COVID-19 webpage. CDC has additional requirements in 
their guidance for businesses and employers. 
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. Complete details, 
including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be found in the guidance. 
The CDPH Face Covering Guidance is subject to additional updates based on the 
current scientific understanding of transmission of the virus causing COVID-19. Please 
check the CDPH website for any revisions.

----------------Page (3) Break----------------
Workplace Specific Plan 
•Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every
location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and
work tasks, and designate a person at each location to implement the
plan.
•Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions.
•Identify contact information for the local health department where the
operation is located for communicating information about COVID-19
outbreaks among workers.
•Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives.
•Regularly evaluate the location for compliance with the plan and
document and correct deficiencies identified.
•Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related factors
could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as needed to
prevent further cases.
•Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines and orders or
guidance from the local health department.
•Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) and
close contacts.
•Notify all employees in writing, and employers of subcontracted
employees, who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and report
workplace outbreaks to the local health department. For additional
information on employer responsibilities under AB 685 (Chapter 84,
Statutes of 2020), refer to the Enhanced Enforcement and Employer
Reporting Requirements from Cal/OSHA and the Employer Questions
about AB 685 from CDPH.
•Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited.
Topics for Worker and Volunteer Training 
•Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which
people are at higher risk for severe illness or death. Establishments that
5
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
keep animals should provide information on how to prevent the spread 
of COVID-19 between people and animals, as it becomes available. 
•Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom
checks, using CDC guidelines.
•The importance of not coming to work if:
oIf a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, such
as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,
fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell,
sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea,
OR
oIf a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been
released from isolation, OR
oIf, within the past14 days, a worker has had contact with someone
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered potentially
infectious (i.e. still on isolation).
•To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only
after meeting CDPH Guidance on Returning to Work or School Following
COVID-19 Diagnosis.
•To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face.
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage.
•The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible
to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). Never use hand sanitizers with
methanol due to its high toxicity to both children and adults.
•The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time
(see Physical Distancing section below).
•Proper use of face coverings, including:
oFace coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE).
oFace coverings do not replace the need for physical distancing and
frequent handwashing.
oFace coverings must cover the nose and mouth.
oWorkers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or
adjusting face coverings.
6
----------------Page (5) Break----------------
oAvoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth.
oFace coverings must not be shared and should be washed or
discarded after each shift.
•Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings.
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled.
•Ensure independent contractors, temporary, volunteer, and all other
types of workers at the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19
prevention policies and have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these
responsibilities ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary
and/or contract workers.
•Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional
information on government  programs supporting sick leave and worker’s
compensation for COVID- 19, including worker’s sick leave rights under
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
•Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers (including
docents, interns, volunteers, etc.) at the beginning of their shift. Make sure
the temperature/symptom screener avoids close contact with workers to
the extent possible.
•If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above.
•Encourage workers, volunteers, and visitors who are sick or exhibiting
symptoms of COVID-19 to stay home.
•Employers must provide and ensure workers and volunteers use all
required protective equipment, including eye protection and gloves
where necessary.
•Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly
touched items. Workers should wear gloves when handling items
contaminated by body fluids.
7
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
•Workers who consistently must be within six feet of guests or co-workers
must wear a secondary barrier (e.g., face shield or safety goggles) in
addition to a face covering. All workers should minimize the amount of
time spent within six feet of guests.
•Use of face coverings is mandatory throughout the facility in all settings
indoor and outdoor. Customers who do not comply should be removed
from the facility immediately. Permit access for customers who are
exempt from wearing face coverings as stated in the CDPH Face
Covering Guidance.
•Museums must take reasonable measures, including posting signage at
entrances, in strategic and highly-visible locations, and in reservation
confirmations, to remind the public that they must use face coverings
whenever not eating or drinking, practice physical distancing, not touch
their face, frequently wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20
seconds, and use hand sanitizer.
•Remind guests in advance to bring a face covering, otherwise they
should not be allowed to enter the premises (unless exempted per the
CDPH Face Covering Guidance). Consider making face coverings
available for customers who may arrive without them.
•Guests and visitors should be screened for temperature and/or symptoms
upon arrival, asked to use hand sanitizer, and to wear a face covering
when not eating or drinking. Employers have the right to cancel
reservations for individuals/parties with symptomatic guests and refuse
entry.
•Display a set of clearly visible rules for guests at entrance(s) that are to be
a condition of entry. The rules could include instructions to use hand
sanitizer, wear face coverings during the visit, maintain physical distance
from workers and other guests/groups, avoid unnecessary touching of
surfaces, contact information for the local health department, and
changes to services. Whenever possible, the rules should be available
digitally and include pictograms.
Ventilation, Cleaning, and Disinfecting 
Protocols 
•Where possible, install portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrade the
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and make other
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in all
working areas and other indoor spaces.
•Where possible, allow at least 30 minutes between different households in
indoor spaces to allow for proper ventilation. This could include staggering
8
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
reservations for activities, if possible. 
•Check the CDPH website periodically for updates on indoor air quality
and ventilation guidance for airborne diseases in indoor settings.
•Frequently clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces such as grab
bars, railings, placards, interactive exhibits, light switches, door handles,
etc. Operators should identify and disinfect surfaces that children are
more likely to touch, such as sections of windows and fence posts closer
to the ground.
•Encourage the use of credit cards and contactless payment systems.
•Perform thorough cleaning of any outdoor and indoor areas that workers
or the public are likely to use or occupy. This should include high traffic
areas and shared workspaces (offices, meeting rooms, break rooms, etc.),
and areas of ingress and egress (handrails, stairways, elevator controls,
etc.)
•Avoid sharing phones, tablets, two-way radios, other work supplies, or
office equipment wherever possible. Never share PPE.
•Where such items must be shared, disinfect with a cleaner appropriate for
the surface between shifts or uses, whichever is more frequent, including
the following: shared office equipment, such as copiers, fax machines,
printers, telephones, keyboards, terminals, ATM PIN pads, staplers, staple
removers, surfaces in reception areas, shared work stations, audio and
video equipment (microphones, microphone stands, mixer boards, TV
monitors, etc.), walkie talkies, tables and chairs, penny machines, photo
booths, vending machines, etc.
•Instruct workers to wipe down and disinfect equipment that passes
between workers and guests such as pens, reusable maps, etc.
•Provide disposable or single-use maps, pamphlets, guides, etc. to guests
and make these available digitally so that guests can view on a personal
electronic device, if possible. If single-use items cannot be provided,
properly disinfect reusable ones before and after customer use.
•To the extent it is consistent with the facility’s obligations to individuals with
disabilities, discontinue the use of audio headsets, strollers, etc., and other
equipment lent to guests unless it can be properly disinfected after each
use. Consult equipment manufacturers to determine appropriate
disinfection steps, particularly for soft, porous surfaces such as foam
earmuffs.
•Equip workplace terminals with proper sanitation products, including hand
sanitizer and sanitizing wipes.
•Ensure that sanitary facilities for workers and guests stay operational and
9
----------------Page (8) Break----------------
stocked at all times and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand 
sanitizer when needed. Provide hand sanitizer and portable sinks for 
visitors where possible at high traffic areas such as entrances. 
•Consider installing and encouraging the use of hands-free devices, if
possible, including touchless time clocks, motion sensor lights, and
automatic soap and paper towel dispensers.
•When choosing cleaning disinfecting chemicals, use products approved
for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-
approved list and follow product instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to
be effective against emerging viral pathogens, diluted household bleach
solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or alcohol solutions with at
least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the surface. Provide workers
training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer’s directions, ventilation
requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers using
cleaners or disinfectants must wear gloves and other protective
equipment as required by the product instructions. Follow the asthma-
safer cleaning methods recommended by the California Department of
Public Health and ensure proper ventilation.
•To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated
with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features are
safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown.
•Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that
can disperse pathogens into the air unless all persons in the area have
appropriate PPE. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever possible.
•Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift.
Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as part of
the workers’ job duties.
•Modify hours, if necessary, to ensure regular, thorough cleaning of
workspaces, as appropriate. Procure options for third-party cleaning
companies to assist with the increased cleaning demand, as needed.
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
•WARNING: physical distancing alone is insufficient to prevent transmission
of COVID-19.
•Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet
between workers and guests and between people waiting in lines. This
can include use of physical partitions, Plexiglas barriers, or visual cues
(e.g., floor markings or signs to indicate to where workers and guests
should stand).
10
----------------Page (9) Break----------------
•Designate separate routes for entry and exit through exhibits, galleries,
viewing areas and workspaces to help maintain physical distancing and
lessen the instances of people closely passing each other, if possible.
Establish one-way directional walkways, passageways, hallways, etc. for
foot traffic, if possible, to minimize crossflow of people moving around
exhibit and workspaces.
•Display signage at entrances, waiting and viewing areas, and throughout
exhibit spaces to remind people of physical distancing, face coverings
usage, and proper hand hygiene at every opportunity.
•Discourage workers and visitors from congregating in high traffic areas
such as bathrooms and hallways. Dedicate staff to direct guests at high
traffic and bottleneck areas in indoor and outdoor facilities to avoid
congregation.
•Consider implementing timed and/or advanced reservation ticketing
systems to stagger patron visits and help maintain physical distances.
•Reconfigure viewing areas for live demonstrations, animal shows, etc. so
that physical distancing can be maintained between household units.
Consider implementing advanced reservations for demonstrations and
having staff members usher households to proper viewing areas.
•Limit customer groups entering the facility to a household unit. People
from the same household do not need to physically distance from one
another.
•Discontinue tours that combine households or individuals from different
households into the same tour group. Tour guides must maintain at least six
feet of physical distance from guests.
•Rearrange seating areas, tables, chairs, benches, etc., and/or remove
seats to allow for a minimum of six feet of physical distance between
users. Post signage at shared, immovable seating (benches, etc.) to
remind guests to physically distance from others outside their party.
•Consider removing, closing, sectioning off, or otherwise regulating
interactive exhibits such as those with touchscreens, grab handles,
buttons, telephone and other listening devices, handheld props, flip doors,
etc. Consider providing disposable stylus pens, disposable covers,
stationing a staff member to monitor and disinfect surfaces after each
use, etc. Make hand sanitizer and/or handwashing facilities available at
these stations and ask visitors to use them before and after interacting
with exhibits. Strongly consider closing these exhibits whenever possible,
especially when children are likely to interact with or share use of these
exhibits without proper disinfection and hand sanitation.
•Consider offering workers, docents, interns, and volunteer staff who
11
----------------Page (10) Break----------------
request modified duties options that minimize their contact with guests 
and other workers (e.g., managing inventory rather than working as a 
cashier or managing administrative needs through telework). 
•Utilize work practices, when feasible and necessary, to limit the number of
workers in shared workspaces at one time. This may include scheduling
(e.g., staggering start/end times), establishing alternating days for on-site
reporting, returning to workspaces in phases, or continued use of telework
when feasible.
•Reconfigure office spaces, workstations, check-out counters, etc. to allow
for at least six feet between workers while at their workstations.
•Reconfigure, restrict, or close breakrooms and create alternative space
for breaks where physical distancing is possible. Limit the number of
people riding in an elevator at one time.
•Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to
maintain physical distancing protocols.
•Eliminate person-to-person contact for delivery of goods to worksites.
•If possible, install transfer-aiding materials, such as shelving and bulletin
boards, to reduce person-to-person hand-offs.
•Redesign parking lots to limit congregation points and ensure proper
separation (e.g. every other space or row, contactless payment, etc.)
•Avoid sharing vehicles when traveling on the property, if possible.
Museums, galleries, botanical gardens, zoos, aquariums, etc., should limit
shuttle service whenever possible and in accordance with obligations to
individuals with disabilities.
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Employers must 
comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as 
guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California 
Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers must be prepared to alter 
their operations as those guidelines change.
