COVID-19 
INDUSTRY 
GUIDANCE: 
Expanded Personal 
Care Services 
October 20, 2020 
This guidance is designed to address 
sectors and activities opening statewide. 
However, local health officers may 
implement more stringent rules tailored 
to local epidemiological conditions, so 
employers should also confirm relevant 
local opening policies.

OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that 
person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, restaurants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not required)
and customers/clients,
frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new cases 
of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and work with 
public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus.

PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for expanded personal care services, which includes 
personal care that requires touching a client’s face, e.g. facials, electrolysis, and waxing. 
This guidance applies to esthetic, skin care, electrology, nail services, body art 
professionals, tattoo parlors, and piercing shops, and massage therapy (in non-
healthcare settings). Businesses in these industries are open across all tiers but must follow 
the modifications in this guidance.  
For the most updated information on county tier status, visit Blueprint for a Safer 
Economy. Please note that local health departments can have more restrictive criteria 
and different closures. Find your county’s local information. 
This guidance is intended to support a safe, clean environment for workers and 
customers. Establishment license holders must acknowledge that renters or lessees should 
only resume operations when they are ready and able to implement the necessary 
safety measures to provide for their safety and that of their customers. 
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory, or collectively bargained and is not exhaustive, as it does not include county 
health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related regulatory 
requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA or the California Board of Barbering and 
Cosmetology.1 Stay current on changes to public health guidance and state/local 
orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has more comprehensive 
guidance on their Cal/OSHA General Guidelines on Protecting Workers from COVID-19 
webpage. CDC has additional requirements in their guidance for businesses and 
employers. 
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. Complete details, 
including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be found in the guidance. 
The CDPH Face Covering Guidance is subject to additional updates based on the 
current scientific understanding of transmission of the virus causing COVID-19. Please 
check the CDPH website for any revisions.

----------------Page (2) Break----------------
Workplace Specific Plan 
•Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every
location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and
work tasks and designate a person at each facility to implement the plan.
•Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions.
•Identify contact information for the local health department where the
facility is located for communicating information about COVID-19
outbreaks among workers or customers.
•Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives.
•Regularly evaluate the workplace for compliance with the plan and
document and correct deficiencies identified.
•Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related factors
could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as needed to
prevent further cases.
•Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines and orders or guidance
from the local health department.
•Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) and
close contacts.
•Notify all employees in writing, and employers of subcontracted
employees, who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and report
workplace outbreaks to the local health department. For additional
information on employer responsibilities under AB 685 (Chapter 84, Statutes
of 2020), refer to the Enhanced Enforcement and Employer Reporting
Requirements from Cal/OSHA and the Employer Questions about AB 685
from CDPH. 
•Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited.
Topics for Worker Training 
•Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and people
who are at higher risk for severe illness or death.
•Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom  checks
using CDC guidelines.
4
----------------Page (3) Break----------------
•The importance of not coming to work:
oIf a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, such
as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,
fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell,
sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea,
OR
oIf a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been
released from isolation, OR
oIf, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered potentially
infectious (i.e. still on isolation).
•To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only after
meeting CDPH Guidance on Returning to Work or School Following
COVID-19 Diagnosis.
•To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face.
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage.
•The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible
to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). Never use hand sanitizers with
methanol due to its high toxicity to both children and adults.
•The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time (see
Physical Distancing section below).
•Proper use of face coverings, including:
oFace coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE).
oFace coverings do not replace the need for physical distancing and
frequent handwashing.
oFace coverings must cover the nose and mouth.
oWorkers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or
adjusting face coverings.
oAvoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth.
oFace coverings must not be shared and should be washed or
discarded after each shift.
•Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and
5
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. 
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who 
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled. 
•Ensure any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at
the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and
have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of
time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers.
•Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional
information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers’
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
•Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the
beginning of their shift and any vendors or contractors entering the
establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom screener avoids close
contact with workers to the extent possible.
•If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above.
•Encourage workers and customers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of
COVID-19 to stay home.
•Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective
equipment, including eye protection, gloves, and face shields where
necessary.
•Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly
touched items. Workers should wear gloves when handling items
contaminated by body fluids.
•Disposable gloves should be worn for services that require them. Wearing
gloves should be done in conjunction with regular hand washing and is not
a substitute for regular hand washing.
•Workers who consistently must be within six feet of customers or co-workers
must wear a secondary barrier (e.g., face shield or safety goggles) in
addition to a face covering. All employees should minimize the amount of
time spent within six feet of customers.
6
----------------Page (5) Break----------------
•Contact customers before visits to confirm appointments and ask if they or
someone in their household is exhibiting any COVID-19 symptoms. If the
customer answers in the affirmative, reschedule the appointment. Such
communication can be done via phone, app, email, or text to remind
customers that they should only come to the facility for their appointment
if they do not pose a health risk to other customers or workers. In order to
implement pre-screening protocols and ensure physical distancing
protocols, consider suspending walk-in appointment availability.
•Tell customers that no additional friends or family will be permitted in the
facility, except for a parent or guardian accompanying a minor.
•Customers should be screened for temperature and/or symptoms upon
arrival, asked to use hand sanitizer, and to wear a face covering unless
exempted per the CDPH Face Covering Guidance. Employers have the
right to refuse entry to symptomatic customers or visitors.
•Display a set of guidelines for customers that are to be a condition of entry.
The guidelines must include instructions to wear face coverings, use hand
sanitizer, maintain physical distance from other customers, and they should
communicate changes to service offerings. The guidelines should be
posted in clearly visible locations, including at entrances, include
pictograms, and be made available digitally (e.g. through email).
Ventilation, Cleaning, and Disinfecting 
Protocols 
•Consider opening treatment room windows, if feasible and within security
protocols.
•Where possible, install portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrade the
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and make other
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in all
working areas.
•Check the CDPH website periodically for updates on indoor air quality and
ventilation guidance for airborne diseases in indoor settings.
•Ensure that coworkers, fellow tenants, booth renters, and/or staff have
coordinated and put a plan in place for cleaning and disinfection at the
beginning and end of each shift and in between customers. Perform
thorough cleaning in high traffic areas, such as reception areas, and areas
of ingress and egress including stairways, stairwells, and handrails.
•Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces including credit card
terminals, counters, reception area seating, door handles, light switches,
phones, toilets, and handwashing facilities.
•Evaluate existing ventilation, hygiene, and sanitation protocols and
7
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
cleaning processes and update where necessary. Use hospital grade, 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved products to clean and 
disinfect anything the client came in contact with, including treatment 
tables, face cradles, stools, bolsters, door knobs, side tables, chairs, etc. 
Follow the product manufacturer’s recommendations for contact time. 
Use disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral 
pathogens, diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon 
of water), or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are 
appropriate for the surface. Provide workers training on the chemical 
hazards, manufacturer’s directions for use, ventilation requirements, and 
Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or 
disinfectants should wear gloves and other protective equipment as 
required by the product. Follow the asthma-safer cleaning methods 
recommended by the California Department of Public Health and ensure 
proper ventilation. 
•Since porous surfaces such as chair seats cannot be easily disinfected,
consider covering with a plastic or disposable liner and cleaning or
disposing of the liner after each customer.
•All appliances at work stations and in treatment rooms should be properly
disinfected between each customer.
oFor non-porous implements, such as tweezers or scissors, clean the item
with hot, soapy water to remove any physical debris. Rinse and dry the
implement completely. Follow by immersing the implement in an EPA-
registered liquid disinfectant that is labeled as a bactericide, fungicide,
and virucide for the full contact time as stated by the manufacturer’s
directions. Items should be removed at the end of contact time, rinsed,
and dried with a clean paper towel.
oFor electrical implements such as magnifying LED lamps, hot towel
warmers, and esthetic devices, clean the implement with a spray or
wipe to remove any physical debris. Follow with an EPA-registered
disinfectant spray or wipe for the full contact time as noted by the
manufacturer’s directions. Use caution when using a spray and be sure
your device is unplugged and do not spray into the motor. For
electronics such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls,
and ATM machines, remove visible contamination if present. Follow the
manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products.
Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics. If no manufacturer
guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol- based wipes or
sprays containing at least 60% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry
surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids.
•To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated
with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems (e.g., drinking
fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown.
8
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
•Where linens are used, even if the customer does not get under them, the
linens should still be removed and the bed or table properly disinfected.
Treatment tables must be covered with either clean treatment table
paper, a clean towel, or a clean sheet after each use.
•Workers should wear disposable gloves when removing used linens, towels,
and other draping, including blankets and client draping for each
treatment. Do not shake the dirty laundry. Place used linens in a lined,
lidded receptacle positioned outside the treatment space, if possible, to
minimize the possibility of dispersing virus in the air. Dirty linens should not be
used again until properly laundered either by a commercial laundering
service or a laundering process which includes immersion in water of at
least 160 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 25 minutes. Store all clean linens in
a clean, covered place.
•Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that
can disperse pathogens into the air unless all persons in the area have
appropriate PPE. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever possible.
•Do not allow food or beverages to be at stations or in treatment rooms.
•Thoroughly clean any product display areas, including all shelving and
display cases. Remove and discard any open “test” products and
discontinue this practice to help reduce contamination. Add signage to
this area to let customers know it is cleaned and disinfected daily.
•Encourage the use of credit cards and contactless payment systems. If
electronic or card payment is not possible, customers should come with
exact cash payment or check.
•Consider upgrading to touchless faucets, soap and paper towel
dispensers, and adding touchless, automatic hand sanitizer dispensers.
Ensure soap dispensers and paper towel dispensers are regularly filled.
•Equip reception areas and workstations with proper sanitation products,
including hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes.
•Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift.
Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as part of
the worker’s job duties.
•Workers should avoid sharing phones, tablets, laptops, desks, pens, and
other work supplies, wherever possible. Never share PPE.
•In addition to the above cleaning and disinfecting protocols, businesses
must follow the existing California Board of Barbering and Cosmetology
rules. Additional rules may also apply for businesses at the local, county-
level.

----------------Page (8) Break----------------
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
•WARNING: physical distancing alone is insufficient to prevent transmission
of COVID-19.
•Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet
between and among workers and customers, except while providing the
services that require close contact. This can include use of physical
partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored tape, or signs to
indicate to where workers and/or customers should stand).
•Maintain at least six feet of physical distance between each work station
area, and/or use impermeable barriers between work stations to protect
customers from each other and workers.
•Stagger appointments to reduce reception congestion and ensure
adequate time for proper cleaning and disinfection between each
customer visit. Consider servicing fewer customers each day or expanding
operating hours to allow for more time between customers and suspending
walk-in appointments.
•If possible, implement virtual check-in technology to ensure that workers
are notified when a customer arrives. Ask customers to wait outside or in
their cars rather than congregating in reception areas. Reception areas
should only have one customer at a time or the area should be modified
to support adequate physical distancing, including removing chairs and
sofas or spacing them further apart.
•For outdoor operations, establish an outdoor reception area where
customers can check in while still following physical distancing guidelines.
Take measures at reception desks or other areas where physical distancing
cannot be maintained to minimize exposure between workers and
customers, such as Plexiglas or other barriers.
•For outdoor operations, create outdoor break areas with shade covers and
seating that ensures physical distancing, where possible.
•Take measures at reception desks or other areas where physical distancing
cannot be maintained to minimize exposure between workers and
customers, such as Plexiglas or other barriers.
•Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., managing
inventory or managing administrative needs through telework).
•Require workers to avoid handshakes, fist bumps, hugs, or similar greetings
that break physical distance.
•Do not allow people to congregate in high traffic areas such as
bathrooms, hallways, bar areas, reservation, and credit card terminals, etc.
10
----------------Page (9) Break----------------
•Ensure workers can maintain physical distance in breakrooms, using
barriers, increasing distance between tables/chairs to separate workers,
etc. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade coverings and
seating arrangements that ensures physical distancing. Discourage workers
from congregating during breaks and ensure they are not eating or
drinking without face coverings within six feet of each other.
•Adjust any staff meetings to ensure physical distancing. Hold meetings over
the phone or via webinar for workers wherever possible.
Additional Considerations for Esthetic and 
Skin Care Services 
•Workers should wear a face shield for eye protection (with a face
covering) when they are providing clients treatment on facial or neck
areas that do not enable the client to wear a face covering.
•Disposable gloves should be worn throughout the entire esthetic service
and while performing cleaning and disinfection of all implements and
surfaces after each client session.
•Before leaving the treatment room or area, remove and dispose of gloves,
apply proper hand sanitizer or wash hands with soap and water, and use a
previously readied disposable barrier, such as a paper towel or sanitizer
wipe, to open and close the treatment room door while leaving the room.
•Single use applicators must be used and disposed of immediately after use
in a lined trash bin. The trash bin should have a lid and should be lined with
a disposable plastic bag.
Additional Considerations for Electrology 
Services 
•Electrology services must not be provided in the outdoor setting because
they are invasive procedures that require a controlled hygienic
environment to be performed safely.
•Electrologists must use disposable gloves during the client’s entire
treatment. Electrologists should wear a face shield for eye protection (with
a face covering) when they are providing clients treatment on facial or
neck areas that do not enable the client to wear a face covering.
•Clients having any other areas treated should be required to wear a face
covering throughout the service, if able to wear one per the CDPH Face
Covering Guidance.
11
----------------Page (10) Break----------------
•Tweezers, rollers, and needle holder caps should be properly cleaned and
sterilized between each client. This could include the use of an autoclave
or placing the items in a sealed pouch and sterilizing them in a dry heat
sterilizer. The pouch should not be reopened until the next client’s
treatment session begins.
•Where possible, use disposable probes that do not require a probe tip or
cap, which will reduce exposure points. If not using disposable probe tips or
caps, the removable tip or cap of the epilator needle/probe holder must
be cleaned and disinfected after each client.
•Needles used for electrolysis must be single-use, disposable, pre- 
packaged, and sterile and disposed of in an approved sharps container
immediately after use. Sharps containers must be discarded in
accordance with biomedical waste regulation.
•Heat produced by the electrical current passing through an electrolysis
needle is not sufficient to sterilize it.
•Ultrasonic cleaning units, forceps, and all containers, including their
removable parts, must be cleaned and disinfected between each client
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
 A      dditional Considerations for Nail Services 
•Clients must wash their hands before nail services are provided.
•Workers must wear face coverings at all times, or a respirator where
required. Respirators are required where ventilation is insufficient to reduce
exposure below permissible exposure limits established in title 8 section
5155. In cases of chemical exposure, only elastomeric respirators with the
correct chemical cartridge combined with a particulate filter are
appropriate for use.
•Disposable gloves should be worn throughout the entire service and while
performing cleaning and disinfection of all implements and surfaces after
each client. Once cleaning is finished, remove and dispose of gloves and
apply proper hand sanitizer or wash hands with soap and water.
•Pedicures done outside shall be limited to portable tubs/bowls and must
be disinfected with an EPA-registered liquid disinfectant that is labeled as
a bactericide, fungicide and virucide. Refer to manufacturer's instructions
on concentration. The disinfection should occur inside the nail salon and
not in the temporary outdoor setting.
•Pedicure bowls must be disinfected with an EPA-registered liquid
disinfectant that is labeled as a bactericide, fungicide and virucide. Refer
to manufacturer's instructions on concentration. For whirlpool foot spas, air-
jet basins or pipeless foot spas, disinfectant must be circulated for at least
12
----------------Page (11) Break----------------
10 minutes. For non-whirlpool foot basins and tubs, soak disinfectant in the 
basin or tub for at least 10 minutes. Foot-spas, basins and pedicure bowls 
must be properly cleaned and disinfected after every client even if a 
disposable plastic liner is used. 
•Nail salons should use disposable supplies whenever possible. Any non- 
disposable supplies must be fully disinfected between customers
according to the California Board of Barbering and Cosmetology
guidelines.
•All single use items, such as cardboard files, sand-bands for drills and
buffers, disposable sandals, toe separators, and applicators, must be used
once and immediately thrown away in a lined, lidded trash can.
•To reduce the number of touchpoints, remove the nail polish displays. In
the absence of a nail polish display, use a color palette, which is to be
cleaned and disinfected after each client use. If the nail polish display is
not removed, nail polishes should be cleaned and disinfected before
being returned to the display.
•Consider whether it is feasible to install a plastic partition between the
worker and client with ample space cut out where hands or feet can be
slid underneath to conduct the manicure or pedicure.
•Allow only one manicurist to work at each station and do not allow clients
to get multiple services at the same time, such as a manicure and
pedicure.
•If fans, such as pedestal fans or hard-mounted fans, are used in the salon,
take steps to minimize air from fans blowing directly from one person
toward another. If fans are disabled or removed, employers should remain
aware of possible heat hazards and take steps to mitigate them.
•Nail salons should consider upgrading existing ventilation to include locally
exhausted nail tables.
Additional Considerations for Body Art 
Professionals, Tattoo Parlors, and Piercing 
Shops 
•Disposable gloves are required throughout the tattooing or piercing
service and while performing cleaning and disinfection of all implements
and surfaces after each customer session.
•Workers should ensure they wash their hands thoroughly with soap and
water or use hand sanitizer immediately before putting on and after
removing gloves.
13
----------------Page (12) Break----------------
•Suspend piercing and tattooing services for the mouth/nose area.
•Chairs should be arranged to ensure at least six feet of space between
customers. Establishments should consider additional divider shields or
other impermeable barriers where appropriate.
•Workers should provide tattooing or piercing services for only one customer
at a time.
Additional Considerations for Massage 
Services (Non-Healthcare Settings) 
•Clients must wash their hands before any services are provided.
•Consider alterations to the treatment table setup to support the required
cleaning and disinfecting protocols. This could include using disposable
face cradle covers and/or protecting the table, table warmers, bolsters,
and other items with washable barriers like pillowcases that can be
removed and replaced between each client. Barriers are not a substitution
for the required cleaning and disinfecting protocols.
•Evaluate whether facial massages or other hands-on work to the face will
be offered. If providing such services, use non-latex gloves for this part of
the treatment. Facial massages should not be performed if it requires
removal of the client’s face covering.
•Provide any hand treatments as the last part of the service.
•Workers should wash their hands immediately upon finishing massage
services.
1 Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Personal care 
providers must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance 
as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the 
California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers should be prepared to 
alter their operations as those guidelines change.
