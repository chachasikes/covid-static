OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at 
home to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that 
may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with 
serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at 
higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when 
people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, 
even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available 
at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating 
that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of 
these workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be takento 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not
required) and customers/clients,
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention
plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for businesses operating in office workspaces to 
support a safe, clean environment for workers. The guidance is not intended to revoke 
or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, regulatory or collectively bargained, and is 
not exhaustive, as it does not include county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any 
existing safety and health-related regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1
Stay current on changes to public health guidance and state/local orders, as the 
COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has more safety and health guidance on 
their Cal/OSHA Guidance on Requirements to Protect Workers from COVID-19 
webpage. CDC has additional guidance for businesses and employers.

Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or
distribution to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance;
•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When
no passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering 
requirements in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful 
workplace. Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers 
for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one 
of the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot 
wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if 
feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude 
any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying 
with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these 
exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Workplace Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at 
every office location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all 
work areas and work tasks, and designate a person at each office 
workspace to implement the plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where 
the facility is located for communicating information about COVID-
19 outbreaks among workers. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on 
the plan and make the plan available to workers and their 
representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the office workspace for compliance with the 
plan and document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan 
as needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a 
workplace has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH 
guidelines. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of 
an infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive 
worker(s) and close contacts. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in 
workplace illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily 
closed or limited. 
Topics for Worker Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and 
which underlying health conditions may make individuals more 
susceptible to contracting the virus. 
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom 
checks using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work:

• If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, 
such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty 
breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of 
taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea, OR 
• If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR 
• If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone 
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered 
potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only 
if 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their 
symptoms have improved, and the worker has had no fevers 
(without the use of fever reducing medications) for the last 72 
hours. A worker without symptoms who was diagnosed with 
COVID-19 can return to work only if 10 days have passed since the 
date of the first positive COVID-19 test. 
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, 
including persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish 
lips orface. Updates and further details are available on CDC’s 
webpage. 
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, 
including scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer 
with at least 60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product 
is inaccessible to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a 
sink or handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work 
time (see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not 
personal protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do 
not replace the need for physical distancing and frequent 
handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth.

o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or discarded 
after each shift. 
• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face 
coverings must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, 
work rules, and practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use 
of face coverings. Training should also include the employer’s policies 
on how people who are exempted from wearing a face covering will 
be handled. 
• Ensure any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers 
at the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies 
and have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities 
ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary and/or 
contract workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to 
receive that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See 
additional information on government programs supporting sick leave 
and worker’s compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave 
rights under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and workers’ 
rights to workers’ compensation benefits and presumption of the work-
relatedness of COVID-19 pursuant to the Governor’s Executive Order N-
62-20 while that Order is in effect. 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or others 
entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom 
screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible. 
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative 
to providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was 
performed prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and 
follows CDC guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training 
section above. 
• Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 
to stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful 
to supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer;

examples are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or 
handling commonly touched items. 
• Employers must take reasonable measures including posting 
signage at all entrances and in strategic and highly-visible locations 
to remind workers that they must use face coverings and practice 
physical distancing, and that they should frequently wash their 
hands with soap for at least 20 seconds use hand sanitizer, and not 
touch their face. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas such as break rooms 
and lunch areas, and areas of ingress and egress including stairways, 
stairwells, escalators, handrails, and elevator controls. Frequently 
disinfect commonly used surfaces including doorknobs, toilets, and 
handwashing facilities. 
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their 
shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as 
part of the worker’s job duties. 
• Adjust or modify hours to provide adequate time for regular 
thorough cleaning and disinfection of office spaces. 
• Avoid sharing phones, other work supplies, or office equipment 
wherever possible. Never share PPE. 
• Where such items must be shared, disinfect between shifts or uses, 
whichever is more frequent, including the following: shared office 
equipment such as copiers, fax machines, printers, telephones, 
keyboards, staplers, surfaces in reception areas, shared work 
stations, etc., with a cleaner appropriate for the surface. 
• Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all 
times and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand 
sanitizer when needed. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use product 
approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. Use 
disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, 
diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), 
or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for 
the surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, 
manufacturer’s directions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA 
requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should

wear gloves as required by the product instructions. Follow the asthma-
safer cleaning methods recommended by the California Department of 
Public Health and ensure proper ventilation. 
• Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods 
that can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA 
filter wherever possible. 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading 
the building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and 
makingother modifications to increase the quantity of outside air 
and ventilation in offices and other spaces. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between workers and customers. This can include use of physical 
partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings or signs to indicate to 
where workers and customers/visitors should stand). 
• Utilize telework options and modified work schedules. 
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options 
that minimize their contact with customers and other workers 
(e.g., managing inventory or managing administrative needs 
through telework). 
• Reconfigure office spaces, cubicles, etc. and decrease the 
capacity for conference and meeting rooms to ensure workspaces 
allow for six feet between workers. 
• Close or restrict common areas, using barriers, or increasing physical 
distance between tables/chairs where personnel are likely to 
congregate and interact, such as kitchenettes and break rooms, and 
discourage workers from congregating in high traffic areas such as 
bathrooms, hallways, and stairwells. 
• Establish directional hallways and passageways for foot traffic, if 
possible, to eliminate workers from passing by one another. 
• Designate separate routes for entry and exit into office spaces to 
help maintain social distancing and lessen the instances of people 
closely passing each other. 
• Limit the number of individuals riding in an elevator at a time. Post 
signage regarding these policies. 
• Utilize work practices, when feasible and necessary, to limit the number

of workers at the office at one time. This may include scheduling (e.g. 
staggering start/end times), establishing alternating days for onsite 
reporting, returning to the office workspace in phases, or continued use 
of telework when feasible. 
• Stagger worker breaks, within compliance with wage and hour 
regulations, to maintain physical distancing protocols. 
• Discontinue nonessential travel and encourage distance meetings 
via phone and internet. 
• Require workers to avoid handshakes and similar greetings that break 
physical distance. 
• Dedicate staff to direct guests to meeting rooms upon entry to 
office space rather than congregating in lobbies or common 
areas. 
• Install production transfer-aiding materials, such as shelving and 
bulletin boards, to reduce person-to-person production hand-offs. 
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Office workspaces 
must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well 
as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California 
Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers must be prepared to alter their 
operations as those guidelines change.
