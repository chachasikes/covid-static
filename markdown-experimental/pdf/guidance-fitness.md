All guidance should be implemented 
only with county health officer approval 
following their review of local 
epidemiological data including cases 
per 100,000 population, rate of test 
positivity, and local preparedness to 
support a health care surge, vulnerable 
populations, contact tracing, and 
testing.

OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that 
person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓ physical distancing to the maximum extent possible, 
✓ use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not 
required) and fitness facility patrons, 
✓ frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, 
✓ training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention 
plan. 
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for fitness facilities to support a safe, clean 
environment for workers. 
NOTE: Fitness facilities with playgrounds should keep those areas closed until such 
facilities are allowed to resume modified or full operation. When allowed to 
reopen to modified or full operation, refer to guidance on the COVID-19 
Resilience Roadmap website. This guidance does not apply to day care or child 
care services, youth camps, team or contact sports, school and educational 
activities, and other public gatherings. For guidance on day camps, outdoor 
recreation, and child care, refer to the guidance on the COVID-19 Resilience 
----------------Page (1) Break----------------
4  
Roadmap website. Most organized activities and sports such as basketball, 
baseball, soccer, and football that are held on park fields, open areas, and 
courts are not permitted to the extent that they require coaches and athletes 
who are not from the same household or living unit to be in close proximity, 
which increases their potential for exposure to COVID-19. Members of the same 
household may engage in such activities and sports together. 
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public 
health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA 
has more safety and health guidance on their Cal/OSHA Guidance on Requirements to 
Protect Workers from Coronavirus webpage. CDC has additional for businesses and 
employers.  
 
Required Use of Face Coverings 
 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure.  
 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
• Interacting in-person with any member of the public; 
• Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether 
anyone from the public is present at the time; 
• Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution 
to others; 
• Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways, 
elevators, and parking facilities; 
• In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the 
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically 
distance; or, 
• Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or 
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no 
passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended. 
 
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering requirements 
----------------Page (2) Break----------------
5  
in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. 
Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the 
reasonable cost of obtaining them.  
 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one of 
the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot 
wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if 
feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. 
 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude 
any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying 
with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these 
exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers. 
 
 
----------------Page (3) Break----------------
 
 
Workplace Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at 
every facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work 
areas and work tasks, and designate a person at each facility to 
implement the plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
facility is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers or patrons. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the workplace for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as 
needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a 
workplace has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive 
worker(s) and close contacts. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
 
Topics for Worker Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to 
contracting the virus. 
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks 
using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work: 
o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the 
CDC, such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, 
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
 
new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, 
nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR  
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with 
someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is 
considered potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 
10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms 
have improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of 
fever reducing medications) for the last 72 hours.  A worker without 
symptoms who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only 
if 10 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 
test.  
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, 
including scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer 
with at least 60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product 
is inaccessible to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a 
sink or handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time 
(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not 
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or discarded 
after each shift. 
• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and 
----------------Page (5) Break----------------
 
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. 
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who 
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled. 
• Ensure independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at the 
facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and 
have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of 
time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive 
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional 
information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers’ 
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under 
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act  and workers’ rights to workers’ 
compensation benefits and presumption of the work-relatedness of 
COVID-19 pursuant to the Governor’s Executive Order N-62-20 while that 
Order is in effect. 
 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors or contractors entering the 
facility. Make sure the temperature/symptom screener avoids close 
contact with workers to the extent possible.  
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to 
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed 
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC 
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. 
• Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to 
stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to 
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are 
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly 
touched items. 
• Workers  should  wash  hands  on  arrival  at  work,  after  working  with each 
fitness facility member, after touching their face covering, after using the 
restroom, and when leaving work. 
• If indoors, workers and patrons must wear face coverings at all times 
except when showering. Showering at home is encouraged where 
possible.  
• The CDPH guidance exempts workers and patrons from wearing face 
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
 
coverings while engaged in exercise outdoors, as long as they are able 
to maintain a distance of at least six feet from others.  
• If possible, implement a reservation system for the facility. Utilize the 
reservation system to contact patrons with reservations 24 hours before 
their scheduled arrival to confirm their reservation and ask if they or 
someone in their household is exhibiting any COVID-19 symptoms. If the 
patron answers in the affirmative the patron should be reminded that 
they should only utilize the fitness facility if they do not pose a health risk 
to other patrons or fitness facility workers. Such communication can be 
done via app, email, or text, if possible. 
• Patrons should be temperature and/or symptom screened upon arrival 
and asked to use hand sanitizer and to wear face coverings in 
accordance with CDPH guidance.  
• Remind patrons in advance to bring a face covering and make them 
available to anyone who arrives without one, if possible. Fitness 
facilities must take reasonable measures, including posting signage at 
all entrances and in strategic and highly-visible locations, to remind 
workers and the public about the use of face coverings and the 
importance of practicing physical distancing. 
 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Evaluate the existing cleaning and disinfecting protocols for the fitness 
facility, including reception areas, locker rooms, restrooms, changing 
areas, and showers and update the cleaning protocols where necessary. 
Fitness facilities should be prepared to: 
o Develop a detailed schedule and adjust or modify operating hours 
to provide adequate time for regular, thorough cleaning and 
disinfecting throughout the day. 
o Perform thorough cleaning throughout the day in high traffic areas, 
such as reception and lobby areas, changing rooms, locker rooms, 
and break rooms and areas of ingress and egress including stairways, 
stairwells, escalators, handrails, and elevator controls. 
o Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces, including personal 
exercise machines and equipment, countertops, vending machines, 
doorknobs, and hand washing facilities. 
o Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their 
shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours 
as part of the workers’ job duties. 
o Make sure all workers have been trained to use and have an 
adequate supply of all-purpose cleaners and disinfectants, when 
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
 
needed. Follow the complete CDC guidelines for cleaning and 
disinfection. Follow Cal/OSHA requirements and manufacturer 
instructions for safe use and required personal protective equipment 
for cleaning products. 
o Workers should have enough ventilation (air flow) in areas where 
they are disinfecting. If cleaning in a bathroom or other small space, 
make sure the door and windows are propped open. 
o Clean HVAC intakes and returns daily. 
o Workers should be supplied with first aid supplies, including bandages 
or other items to cover any cuts, scratches, or open wounds on skin 
and have sufficient supply to change the bandages often. 
o Patrons should be reminded to maintain six feet of distance from 
janitorial or custodial workers. Implement a process to regularly 
check in with workers to ensure visitors are following this protocol. 
Ensure workers are able to share such information without fear of 
reprisal or retaliation. 
o Procure options for third-party cleaning companies to assist with the 
increased cleaning demand, as needed. 
• Equip entrances and exits, exercise machines, fitness rooms, changing 
rooms and locker rooms, and other areas with proper sanitation products, 
including hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes, and provide personal hand 
sanitizers to workers who regularly engage with patrons (e.g., reception 
workers). 
• Require patrons to disinfect individual exercise equipment, mats, and 
machines before and after use with provided disinfecting wipes. Ensure 
that lined, non-touch trash receptacles are available throughout the 
fitness facility to dispose of used wipes. 
• If members are unable or unwilling to wipe/disinfect equipment after 
exercise, provide “ready to clean” tags for members to place on 
equipment after use, to ensure equipment is disinfected before the 
next use. 
• Consider implementing a check-out system for patrons to utilize any small 
equipment and accessories (i.e. exercise bands, ropes, mats, foam rollers, 
etc.). Develop a process to clean and disinfect these items upon return. 
• Follow CDC guidelines to ensure that all water systems are safe to use 
after a prolonged facility shutdown to minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ 
disease and other diseases associated with water. 
• Wherever possible, install touchless, automatic water dispensers for use 
with personal, reusable water bottles or single-use, disposable paper 
cups. Display signage reminding workers and patrons that the bottle or 
----------------Page (8) Break----------------
 
cup should not touch the water dispenser. If a touchless water 
dispenser is not feasible, remind workers and patrons to wash their 
hands or use proper hand sanitizer before and after touching the 
water release button on drinking fountains. 
• Encourage patrons to bring their own towels and mats and consider 
disbanding the provision of any facility-provided towels or personal 
hygiene products. 
• For any towels, cloth wipes, or other laundered items that are used at the 
facility, follow CDC guidelines for those items. Provide a closed container 
where patrons can place used towels or other items. Ensure those items 
cannot be used again until properly laundered either by a commercial 
laundering service or a laundering process which includes immersion in 
water of at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 25 minutes. Store all 
clean linens in a clean, covered place. Ensure workers who handle dirty 
linens or laundry wear gloves. 
• Amenities, including magazines, books, self-serve water stations (unless 
touchless), and other items for patrons, must be removed from reception 
areas and elsewhere in the fitness facility. Non-essential vanity items 
should also be removed from locker rooms to help reduce touch points. 
• Workers and patrons should avoid shaking hands, bumping fists or 
elbows, and other physical contact. Workers should also avoid sharing 
tools, phones, electronics, and office supplies as much as possible and, 
where feasible, ensure workers have dedicated workstations for their 
personal use. Never share PPE. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use products 
approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. Use 
disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, 
diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), 
or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the 
surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, 
manufacturer’s directions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA 
requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should 
wear gloves and other protective equipment as required by the 
product. Follow the asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended by 
the California Department of Public Health and ensure proper 
ventilation. 
• Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods 
that can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA 
filter wherever possible. 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the 
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other 
----------------Page (9) Break----------------
 
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in 
offices and other spaces. 
• Place signage throughout the fitness facility emphasizing basic 
infection prevention measures, including the importance of wearing 
face coverings and frequent handwashing. 
 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between and among workers and patrons. This can include use of 
physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored tape, or 
signs to indicate to where workers and/or patrons should stand during 
check-in at reception areas or when waiting to use equipment). 
• Space equipment at least six feet apart, with greater distancing for 
treadmills and other high-exertion aerobic fitness equipment. Equipment 
can be arranged in an “X” pattern to provide greater distancing. Physical 
barriers can also be helpful to minimize exposure between patrons or 
segregate exercise areas. 
• Equip the front desk area with Plexiglas or other impermeable barriers, if 
feasible, to minimize the interaction between reception workers and 
patrons. Implement virtual, touchless check-in tools, if possible, so that 
patrons do not have to utilize the reception space. 
• Consider suspending non-core activities, including retail operations, spa 
services, childcare, family programming, and food service. If fitness 
facilities operate such amenities, they should review the related 
guidance for these services on the COVID-19 Resilience Roadmap 
website. 
• Consider implementing special hours designated for high risk or 
medically-vulnerable populations, including seniors with admittance by 
reservation only. 
• Evaluate maximum occupancy rules based on the size of the facility to 
develop a capacity plan that supports physical distancing and limits the 
number of patrons allowed in the facility at a given time to a number 
permitting such distancing. Other considerations to support physical 
distancing in the facility for patrons could include: 
o Implementing an online reservation-based system, as suggested in 
the Individual Control Measures and Screening section of this 
document, to avoid patrons queuing in the facility or outside and 
help maintain occupancy levels. 
o Limiting the number of patrons in the facility at one time. Only those 
----------------Page (10) Break----------------
 
patrons that are actually exercising should be inside the facility. 
Patrons should not wait in the reception area. 
o Using one-way foot traffic patterns throughout the fitness facility with 
visual cues and signs. 
o Removing communal furniture and/or cordoning off member lounge 
areas. 
o Staggering available lockers in locker rooms to maintain physical 
distancing. 
o Spacing all equipment and machines at least six feet apart or taking 
some out of service to achieve physical distancing. 
o Adjusting personal training so that the exercise instructor maintains a 
minimum of six feet of physical distance. 
o Modifying group training classes to limit the class size to ensure a 
minimum of six feet of physical distance between patrons and/or 
move the classes outdoors or to larger spaces like full-sized 
basketball courts, if possible. Group exercise classes should only be 
offered if distancing requirements can be maintained and there is 
no person-to-person physical contact. 
• High contact programs that require close contact less than six feet in 
distance should be suspended. This would include activities such as 
group sporting events, organized intermural activities, pick-up basketball, 
or organized races. 
• Adjust in-person meetings for workers, if they are necessary, to ensure 
physical distancing and use virtual options or smaller meetings at facilities 
to maintain physical distancing guidelines. 
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with patrons and other workers (e.g., 
managing administrative needs through telework). 
• Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour 
regulations, to maintain physical distancing protocols. 
• Close breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance between 
tables/chairs to separate workers and discourage congregating during 
breaks. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade covers 
and seating that ensures physical distancing. 
 
 
 
----------------Page (11) Break----------------
 
Additional Considerations for Communal 
Restrooms and Shower Facilities 
 
• Fitness facilities should consider staffing and other capacity and resource 
needs to ensure that locker rooms and shower facilities can be cleaned 
and disinfected regularly throughout the day. 
• Shared restroom facilities and locker rooms should be cleaned regularly 
throughout the day using EPA-registered disinfectants. High-touch 
surfaces such as faucets, toilets, doorknobs, and light switches must be 
frequently cleaned and disinfected. 
• Create and post a cleaning schedule for the restroom facilities and 
locker rooms. Post the cleaning schedule on the front of the door so 
patrons know when they can/cannot use the restroom and/or locker 
room. Make sure to close the restroom during the cleaning and 
disinfecting process. 
• Consider using a checklist or audit system to track how often cleaning is 
conducted. 
• Only allow shower and locker room use if partitions are in place or signs 
have been posted to specify physical distancing requirements. If 
partitions or proper distancing are not possible, these facilities should 
remain closed. 
• Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and are continuously 
stocked at all times. Provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand 
sanitizer when needed. Install hands-free devices, if possible, including 
motion sensor sinks faucets, soap dispensers, sanitizer dispensers, and 
paper towel dispensers. 
• Doors to multi-stall restrooms should be able to be opened and closed 
without touching the handles, using opening-devices, or powered door 
operators with the hand, whenever possible. If the door cannot be 
opened without touching the handle or door-operator with the hand, 
place a trash-receptacle by the door to ensure a paper towel can be 
readily disposed of when operating the door. The location and 
positioning of waste receptacles should not interfere with egress, 
evacuation, emergency equipment, or any reasonable 
accommodations provided under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
Make sure trash cans are emptied regularly. 
• Fitness facility patrons should be instructed that sinks could be an 
infection source and should avoid placing hairbrushes and other items 
directly on counter surfaces. Totes could also be used for personal 
items to limit their contact with other surfaces in the restroom or locker 
room. 
----------------Page (12) Break----------------
 
• Provide information on how to wash hands properly, including hanging 
signs in restrooms. 
 
 
Additional Considerations for Swimming Pools 
/ Aquatic Venues 
 
• Fitness facilities with swimming pools or splash pads should take additional 
steps to ensure those facilities are properly cleaned and disinfected for 
patron use, according to CDC guidelines. 
• Fitness facilities that have swimming pools which include water slides, 
water rides, or other water attractions must keep those areas closed 
until such operations can resume. Swimming pools themselves can 
remain open. 
• Please note that saunas, steam rooms, and hot tubs should remain 
closed until such operations can resume. 
• Advise workers and patrons not to wear face coverings while in the 
water, and to otherwise wear them in accordance with the CDPH face 
covering guidance. Cloth face coverings can be difficult to breathe 
through when they are wet. Face coverings should be put away when 
not in use so they are not accidentally touched or picked up by others. 
• Maintain proper disinfectant levels (1-10 parts per million free chlorine or 
3-8 ppm bromine) and pH (7.2-8). 
• Consult with the company or engineer that designed the aquatic venue 
to decide which List N disinfectants approved by the EPA are best for the 
aquatic venue. Ensure the safe and correct use and storage of 
disinfectants, including storing products securely away from children. 
• Set up a system so that furniture and equipment (e.g., lounge chairs) that 
needs to be cleaned and disinfected is kept separate from furniture that 
has already been cleaned and disinfected. Label containers for used 
equipment that has not yet been cleaned and disinfected and 
containers for cleaned and disinfected equipment. 
• Encourage patrons to bring and use their own towels wherever possible. If 
the facility is providing them, launder towels according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Use the warmest appropriate water 
temperature and dry items completely. Handle towels with disposable 
gloves and minimal disturbance, i.e., do not shake them. 
• Discourage people from sharing items, particularly those that are difficult 
to clean and disinfect or those that are meant to come in contact with 
the face (e.g., goggles, nose clips, and snorkels). 
----------------Page (13) Break----------------
 
• Ensure that the facility has adequate equipment for patrons, such as kick 
boards, pool noodles, and other flotation devices, to minimize sharing 
wherever possible. Clean and disinfect the items after each use. 
• For indoor aquatic venues, introduce and circulate outdoor air as much 
as possible by opening windows and doors, using fans, or other methods. 
However, do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety risk 
to workers, patrons, or swimmers. 
• Change the deck layout and other areas surrounding the pool to ensure 
that the standing and seating areas can support physical distancing 
requirements. This could include removing lounge chairs or taping off 
areas to discourage use. 
• Provide physical cues or guides (e.g., lane lines in the water or chairs and 
tables on the deck) and visual cues (e.g., tape on the decks, floors, or 
sidewalks) and signs to ensure that workers, patrons, and swimmers stay 
at least six feet apart from one another, both in and out of the water. 
• Where feasible, install impermeable physical barriers such as Plexiglas 
where workers and patrons must interact and physical distancing is 
difficult. 
• Consider implementing reservations for pool use or implementing other 
mechanisms to support physical distancing. This could include reserving 
full-lanes for individual lap swimming and half-lanes for individual 
household use. 
• Ensure that lifeguards who are actively lifeguarding are not also 
expected to monitor handwashing, use of cloth face coverings, or 
physical distancing. Assign this monitoring responsibility to another 
worker. 
• Aquatic venues should avoid activities that promote group gatherings 
and should be aware of local policies on gathering requirements to 
determine if aquatic fitness classes, swim lessons, swim team practices, 
swim meets, or pool parties can be held. 
• CDC’s Model Aquatic Health Code has more recommendations to 
prevent illness and injuries at public pools in parks. 
 
Additional Considerations for Food Service 
(Including Juice Bars, Snack Bars, and 
Concessions) and Retail 
• Food service operations, including juice bars, snack bars, and other 
concessions must be run in accordance with current orders and 
guidelines for such establishments available on the COVID-19 Resilience 
----------------Page (14) Break----------------
 
15 
Roadmap website. All self-service food stations should be closed. 
• Where possible, patrons should order food items online or over the 
phone and food should be available for pick-up. If not possible to pre-
order food items, ensure that those waiting in line to order can maintain 
appropriate physical distancing. 
• Snack bars and concessionaires should sell pre-packed and individually 
wrapped food wherever possible. Wrap silverware or plasticware 
individually within a napkin so people are not picking them out of a 
group of utensils in a basket, cup, or box. 
• Encourage the use of credit cards or accept payment over the phone, if 
possible, for food and retail items. Ensure the payment system is wiped
