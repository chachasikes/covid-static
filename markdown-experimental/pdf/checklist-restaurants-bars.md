wipes and ensure availability. 
 Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times.

Agency (EPA)-approved list and train workers on chemical hards, product 
instructions, ventilation requirements, Cal/OSHA requirements, and the CDPH 
asthma-safer cleaning methods.

than disinfecting) food contact surfaces.

----------------Page (1) Break----------------

 Open windows and consider upgrades to improve air filtration and ventilation.

disperse pathogens into the air. 
 Provide menus via alternative means, such as disposable paper menus, chalk 
boards, white boards, or digital menus viewable on electronic devices. 
 Provide disposable order numbers/table trackers or disinfect them before and 
after customer use. 
 Provide table settings (napkins, cutlery, glassware, etc.) to customers only as 
needed. 
 Supply shared condiments only as needed or supply single serve containers. 
 Pre-roll utensils in napkins prior to use by customers and store in a clean container.

 Encourage customer reservations and appointments. 
 Ask customers to wait in their cars away from the establishment and alert them 
that their table is ready through their mobile phones. Avoid using “buzzers.” 
 Adjust maximum occupancy rules and implement measures to physically 
separate workers and customers by at least six feet using measures such as 
reconfiguring space, installing physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor 
markings, colored tape, or signs to indicate to where workers should stand). 
 Install physical barriers where maintaining physical distance of six feet is difficult. 
 Clearly mark areas where people queue for appropriate physical distancing.

 Stagger employee breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, if 
needed.

alternative where physical distancing can be practiced, and discourage 
employees from congregating. 
 Reconfigure spaces to allow at least six feet of distance between people dining, 
working, and passing through areas. 
 Reconfigure kitchens or work to maintain physical distancing in those areas where 
practical.
