physical distancing, frequently wash their hands with soap, use hand sanitizer, 
and not touch their face.

and provide them to those who arrive without one.

----------------Page (1) Break----------------
 Remove items that are difficult to clean and sanitize from meeting areas. 
 Encourage visitors to bring and use items such as personal prayer rugs, cushions, 
songbooks, etc. Discourage sharing of such items. 
 If providing prayer books, etc., disinfect between uses. Provide enough time 
between services for workers to complete cleaning/disinfecting. Alternatively, 
provide disposable printed copies of items. 
 Wash religious garments and linens after each service or event. Ask 
congregants/visitors to bring their own storage bags for personal garments and 
shoes. 
 Workers and visitors wear gloves when handling others’ dirty linens, shoes, etc. 
 Do not pass around offering plates and similar items that move between people. 
Use alternate giving options such as secure drop boxes that do not require 
opening/closing and can be cleaned and disinfected. Consider digital systems 
that allow touch-free offerings. 
 Mark walking paths so that people do not walk where a guest or visitor may touch 
their head to the floor while praying. 
 Open windows if weather permits or run ventilation systems to introduce fresh 
outside air. 
 Clean floors using a vacuum with HEPA filter or other methods that do not 
disperse pathogens into the air.

Physical Distancing Guidelines 
 Provide services through alternative methods such as internet streaming, 
telephone, drive-in, etc. 
 Hold in-person meetings and services outside when possible. 
 Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet between 
workers, visitors, etc., including use of physical partitions or visual cues. 
 Reconfigure seating and standing areas to allow for six-foot physical distance 
between congregants/visitors. 
 Shorten services to limit the length of time congregants/visitors spend at facilities. 
 Use a reservation system to limit the number of visitors at facilities at one time. 
 Encourage congregants/visitors to meet with the same group each time. 
 Add additional meeting times so fewer guests attend each one. Clean meeting 
areas between each use. 
 Discontinue large gatherings that encourage visitors to travel and break physical 
distances during activities.

of at least six feet cannot be maintained. 
 Encourage congregants/visitors to physically distance themselves from others 
outside their household, avoid touching surfaces, and to leave the facility if they 
do not feel well.   
----------------Page (2) Break----------------
 Consider limiting touching for religious and/or cultural purposes, such as holding 
hands, to members of the same household.   
 Dedicate workers to direct guests to meeting rooms upon entry to places of 
worship rather than congregating in lobbies or common areas. 
 Help visitors find places to sit or stand that are at least six feet away from others. 
Ask them to arrive and leave in a single group. 
 Prop or hold doors open during peak periods when visitors are entering and 
exiting facilities, if possible.   
 Close or restrict common areas, such as break rooms, kitchenettes, foyers, etc., 
where people are likely to congregate and interact, or install barriers if using 
these areas. 
 Remove or find low-community-touch alternatives for communal/religious water 
containers. Empty and change water between uses. Use shields to cover the eye, 
nose, and mouth if splashing is possible. Disinfect the PPE properly between uses. 
 When washing is a required activity, modify practices to limit splashing. 
Encourage washing to be performed at home prior to entering the facility. 
 Reconfigure podiums and speaker areas, office spaces, meeting rooms, 
conference rooms, etc., to allow for at least six feet between people. 
 Establish directional hallways and passageways for foot traffic, if possible, and 
designate separate routes for entry and exit into meeting rooms, offices, etc. 
 Welcome and dismiss congregants/visitors in an orderly way to maintain physical 
distancing and minimize crossflow of traffic, to the extent possible. 
 Limit the number of individuals riding in an elevator at a time. Post signage 
regarding these policies. 
 Utilize work practices, when feasible and necessary, to limit the number of workers 
and visitors in office, meeting spaces, etc., at one time. 
 Consider offering workers and volunteers who request modified duties options 
that minimize their contact with congregants/visitors and other workers. 
 Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations. 
 Discontinue nonessential travel and encourage distance meetings via phone and 
internet. 
 Close self-service item selection such as pamphlet displays and bookshelves. 
Provide items to congregants/visitors individually as necessary or electronically. 
 Consider limiting the number of people that use the restroom at one time to allow 
for physical distancing. 
 Discourage workers, congregants, visitors, etc., from engaging in handshakes, 
hugs, and similar greetings that break physical distance. Take reasonable 
measures to remind people to wave or use other greetings. 
 Reconfigure parking lots to limit congregation points and ensure proper 
separation. If performing drive-in services, ensure vehicle windows and doors are 
closed if six feet of distance is not possible between vehicles.

Considerations for Places of Worship 
 Discontinue offering self-service food and beverages to visitors. Do not hold 
potlucks or similar family-style eating and drinking events that increase the risk of 
cross contamination. If food and beverages must be served, provide items in 
single-serve, disposable containers whenever possible. Workers or volunteers 
serving food should wash hands frequently and wear disposable gloves. 
 Discontinue singing, group recitation, and other practices and performances, or 
ensure physical distancing greater than six feet. 
 Modify practices that are specific to particular faith traditions that might 
encourage the spread of COVID-19. 
  
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
Considerations for Funerals 
 Limit visitor capacity and stagger visitation times at funerals, wakes, etc. 
 Remind visitors to maintain physical distance. 
 Modify religious or cultural practices when washing or shrouding bodies of those 
who have died from COVID-19, in accordance with guidance from the CDPH 
and CDC. If there will be splashing of fluids, use PPE for eyes, nose, and mouth. 
 Consult and comply with local guidance regarding limits on gathering sizes, 
travel, holding funerals for those who died from COVID-19, etc.
