for Campgrounds, RV Parks, and Outdoor Recreation  
July 2, 2020 
This checklist is intended to help campgrounds and RV parks implement their plan to prevent the 
spread of COVID-19 in the workplace and is supplemental to the Guidance for Campgrounds,

these policies and ensure they have necessary PPE. 
Individual Control Measures & Screening 
 Symptom screenings and/or temperature checks. 
 Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to stay 
home. 
 Provide and ensure workers use PPE, such as eye protection and gloves. 
 Encourage frequent handwashing and use of hand sanitizer. 
 Provide disposable gloves as a supplement to handwashing to workers who 
screen for symptoms or handle commonly touched items. 
 Contact visitors with reservations before their scheduled arrival and ask if a 
member of the party has symptoms, been sick, or been exposed to anyone who 
has been sick. If yes, cancel the reservation. 
 Before visitor arrivals, communicate to guests the park’s new policies and 
procedures for check-in, physical distancing, and cleaning and disinfection 
schedules. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
 Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas.  
 Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces and items in facilities and vehicles. 
 Clean and sanitize shared equipment between each use. 
 Make hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes available at guest reception and check-
in areas and staff workstations.  
 Remove amenities, such as trail maps, magazines, coffee, water, and self-serve 
stations (unless touchless) from reception areas. 
 Do not loan out items that are difficult to clean, or if loaning, keep them in 
storage for at least three days before loaning to a different visitor. 
 Ensure all water systems are safe to use to minimize risk of Legionnaires’ disease. 
 Encourage visitors to bring their own hand sanitizer. 
 Clean restroom facilities on an accelerated schedule, and provide disposable 
toilet seat covers. 
 Encourage guests to pack out what they pack in. 
 Clean and disinfect water filling stations, RV dump stations, and propane filling 
stations daily, and wipe down the equipment after each use. Place hand sanitizer 
near these facilities for guests and staff. 
 Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times.  
----------------Page (1) Break----------------
 Avoid sharing tools, phones, and office supplies. Never share PPE. 
 Use products approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and train workers on chemical hazards, product 
instructions, ventilation requirements, Cal/OSHA requirements, and the CDPH 
asthma-safer cleaning methods. 
 Adjust or modify hours to provide adequate time for workers to clean during their 
shift. Use third-party cleaning services where feasible and appropriate. 
 Consider upgrades to improve air filtration and ventilation. 
 After each visitor stay, wipe down and clean amenities, including BBQ grills, 
chairs, water spigots, RV electrical and water hook-ups, etc. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
 Implement measures to physically separate people by at least six feet using 
measures such as physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., Plexiglas barriers in stores 
or visitor centers, or signs to indicate to where to stand to queue). 
 Have employees work in teams and stagger worker shifts and breaks, in 
compliance with wage and hour regulations.  
 Avoid shaking hands, bumping fists or elbows, and other physical contact. 
 Monitor areas where people are likely to gather, to ensure physical distancing 
and other guidelines are followed. 
 Use a reservation system for any paid, controlled outdoor activities. 
 Implement remote check-in. Post signs at the park’s entrance to inform guests 
what they need to do upon arrival. Encourage credit card payment or payment 
over the phone or online. 
 If remote check-in is not possible, check-in visitors outside and email receipts. 
 Ensure only one household per campsite or rental unit. 
 Do not allow entry of non-registered guests. 
 Limit the capacity of any on-site stores or other facilities to ensure physical 
distancing can be maintained.

have staff deliver the items to the guest’s campsite or RV. 
 Close off outdoor spaces for group gatherings. 
 Cancel or postpone all public events and concentrated gatherings. 
 Post physical distancing-related restrictions at smaller picnic shelters. 
 Operate at decreased capacity if necessary for physical distancing. 
 Adjust any staff meetings and interviews to ensure physical distancing or hold 
them over the phone, via webinar, or outdoors.  
----------------Page (2) Break----------------
Additional Considerations for Outdoor Recreation 
 Assess risks of the recreational activities offered (e.g., person-to-person 
interactions, sharing of equipment by multiple participants, length of interaction) 
and do not offer the higher risk activities. 
 Customers/guests/visitors should have face coverings with them and ready to put 
on when they cannot maintain physical distancing. 
 Evaluate the process for renting and loaning recreational equipment to 
determine if there is adequate staff capacity and cleaning and disinfecting 
supplies. 
 Modify outdoor recreational activities, where necessary, to ensure proper 
cleaning and disinfecting protocols can be implemented (e.g., encourage visitors 
to bring their own equipment, ensure handwashing facilities, remove shared on-
site equipment that cannot be cleaned and disinfected between uses). 
 Clean and disinfect “soft goods,” such as life jackets, cotton lead ropes, and 
saddle bags, and allow for sufficient “down time” of at least three days between 
uses. 
 Cancel high contact programs and sports that require close contact less than six 
feet in distance between members of different households. 
 Limit high or close contact outdoor recreation activities to household units. 
 Modify outdoor recreational activities where there is no close contact, so multiple 
households can use the facility or equipment while maintaining physical 
distancing. 
 Maintain physical distancing when outfitting people with helmets, gear, 
lifejackets, etc. 
  
----------------Page (3) Break----------------
Additional Considerations for Communcal 
Restroom and Shower Facilities 
 Adjust maximum occupancy based on the number of fully-operational restrooms 
that the operator can maintain and which can support physical distancing. 
 Clean shared restroom facilities with EPA-registered disinfectants regularly, at least 
twice a day, and provide staff with required protective equipment. 
 Create and post a cleaning schedule on the front of the door in every open 
restroom facility, and close the restroom during the cleaning and disinfection 
process. 
 Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and are continuously stocked at all 
times. 
 Ensure doors to multi-stall restrooms can be opened and closed without touching 
the handles or opening controls, or place a trash receptacle by the door so 
people can use and dispose of a paper towel when operating the door.  
 Make sure the trash receptacle does not interfere with egress, evacuation, 
emergency equipment, or any reasonable accommodations provided under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act. Make sure trash cans are emptied regularly. 
 Advise visitors that sinks could be an infection source so they should not place 
toothbrushes and other items directly on counter surfaces. 
 Only allow shower use if there are partitions in the shower facility. Otherwise, limit 
the number of people using it at one time. 
 Encourage guests staying in vehicles with toilets and showers/bathing equipment 
to use their own facilities instead of shared ones. 
 Post signs in restrooms on how to wash hands properly. 
  
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
Additional Considerations for Swimming Pools 
and Aquatic Venues 
 Follow CDC guidelines to ensure that swimming pools and splash pads are 
cleaned and disinfected properly for visitor use. 
 Keep water slides, water rides, and other water attractions closed until such 
operations can resume. 
 Keep saunas, steam rooms, and hot tubs closed until such operations can 
resume. 
 For indoor pools, face coverings must be worn when out of the water or shower 
areas, unless exempt from the CDPH guidance. 
 For outdoor pools, face coverings must be worn when out of the water whenever 
six-foot physical distancing cannot be maintained, unless exempt under the 
CDPH guidance. 
 Maintain proper disinfectant levels and pH. 
 Ensure safe and correct use and storage of EPA-registered disinfectants, and store 
products securely away from children. 
 Set up a system to distinguish furniture and equipment that have already been 
cleaned versus those that have not. 
 Encourage visitors to bring and use their own towels. Launder any provided towels 
and clothing at the warmest appropriate temperature according to 
manufacturer’s instructions. Dry items completely. Handle towels with disposable 
gloves and minimal disturbance. 
 Ensure that the facility has adequate equipment for patrons, such as kick boards, 
pool noodles, and other flotation devices, to minimize sharing. Limit the use of the 
equipment to one patron at a time and clean and disinfect the items after each 
use. 
 For indoor aquatic venues, introduce and circulate outdoor air as much as 
possible by opening windows and doors, using fans, or other methods, as long as 
it does not pose a safety risk. 
 Rearrange the deck layout and other areas surrounding the pool to ensure that 
the standing and seating areas can support physical distancing. 
 Provide physical cues or guides (e.g., lane lines in the water or chairs and tables 
on the deck) and visual cues (e.g., tape on the decks, floors, or sidewalks) and 
signs to ensure that staff, visitors, and swimmers stay at least six feet apart from 
one another, both in and out of the water. 
 Consider implementing reservations for pool use or implementing other 
mechanisms to support physical distancing. 
 Assign workers other than lifeguards to monitor handwashing, use of cloth face 
coverings, and physical distancing. 
  
----------------Page (5) Break----------------
Additional Considerations for Cabins and Rental 
Units 
 Clean and disinfect rental units after each use. 
 Launder all linens between each visitor stay, including items that appear to not 
have been used. Supply and ensure staff use disposable gloves when handling 
dirty laundry.  
 Do not store extra linens in the rental unit. Provide such items only on request. 
 Do not shake dirty laundry. 
 Launder items at the warmest appropriate setting for the items and dry 
completely. 
 Clean and disinfect laundry hampers. Place a bag liner that is disposable and 
thrown away after each use or can be laundered after each use. 
 Thoroughly clean kitchen items with soap and hot water, preferably in a 
dishwasher, between each visitor stay. Provide adequate dish soap and new, 
unused sponges for each visitor upon arrival. Consider replacing utensils with one-
time use dinnerware, if feasible. 
  
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
Additional Considerations for Food and Dining 
 Run dine-in restaurants, bars, snack bars, and other concessions in accordance 
with current orders and guidelines for such establishments. Close all self-service 
stations. 
 Have visitors order food items online or over the phone and make food available 
for pickup at walk-up snack bars. If pre-ordering is not available, ensure visitors 
maintain physical distancing when ordering food items. 
 Sell pre-packed and individually wrapped food wherever possible. Wrap 
silverware and plasticware individually in a napkin. 
 Encourage the use of credit cards or accept payment over the phone for food 
items. 
 Do not hold potlucks or similar family-style eating and drinking events. Provide 
items in single-serve, disposable containers whenever possible instead. 
  
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
Additional Considerations for Campground and 
RV Park Laundry Facilities 
 Adjust the operating hours for laundry room facilities to ensure that staff have 
adequate time to frequently clean and disinfect. 
 Place hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes in the laundry room. 
 Remove games, books, brochures, etc. Also remove laundry baskets or bins, if 
provided. 
 Consider developing an appointment system for the laundry facilities. 
 If not possible to implement an appointment system, maintain physical distancing 
by closing every other machine. Encourage visitors to wait outside while laundry is 
being washed/dried, or use visual cues to direct visitors where to stand. 
 Post a maximum-occupancy sign and the cleaning and disinfection schedule on 
the door. 
  
----------------Page (8) Break----------------
Additional Considerations for Ground and 
Building Maintenance 
 Train all workers to use all-purpose cleaners and disinfectants, and have an 
adequate supply. Follow CDC guidelines. 
 Clean touchable surfaces between shifts or between users, whichever is more 
frequent. 
 Minimize or eliminate use of shared equipment and tools. If tools are 
shared, sanitize between each use and at the end of the workday. 
 Workers must wash hands or use sanitizer between use of shared 
equipment. Allow paid work time to do so. 
 Inform janitorial or custodial workers if they are going to be working in a location 
where an infected person has been. Use qualified third-party cleaning services for 
decontamination of affected areas. 
 Close and ventilate for 24 hours any area where an infected person has been, 
before workers enter to clean. 
 Provide proper protective equipment (e.g., disposable gloves, eye goggles) and 
training to janitorial workers who are asked to disinfect an area with known 
COVID-19 cases. 
 Ensure proper ventilation in areas where workers are cleaning, and use asthma-
safer disinfectants. 
 Provide adequate first-aid supplies. 
 Remind visitors to maintain six feet of distance from maintenance, janitorial, or 
custodial staff. Regularly check in with workers to ensure visitors are following this 
protocol. Do not retaliate against workers sharing such information. 
 Expand, limit occupancy of, or close dog parks, based on whether physical 
distancing can be maintained for visitors and their animals. 
  
----------------Page (9) Break----------------
Additional Considerations for Visitors 
 Plan ahead. Make reservations and purchase permits, firewood, ice, and other 
items online or by phone before arriving on-site. Be prepared with cashless or 
minimal-contact payment methods. 
 Be prepared to be as self-contained and self-sufficient as possible. For example, 
bring your own soap, surface disinfectants, hand sanitizer, paper towels, and toilet 
paper. Bring surface wipes to clean up before and after use of common facilities. 
Bring your own sports equipment, first aid supplies, towels, table cloths, and other 
items for outdoor recreation. 
 Set up campsites or picnic areas to maximize distance from adjacent campsites 
and picnic sites that host people from other households. 
 Follow all rules and updated policies.
