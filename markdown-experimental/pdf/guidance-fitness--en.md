COVID-19 
INDUSTRY 
GUIDANCE: 
Fitness Facilities 
October 20, 2020 
This guidance is designed to address 
sectors and activities opening statewide. 
However, local health officers may 
implement more stringent rules tailored 
to local epidemiological conditions, so 
employers should also confirm relevant 
local opening policies.

OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that 
person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, restaurants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not
required) and fitness facility patrons,
frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention
plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus.

PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for fitness facilities to support a safe, clean 
environment for workers, customers, and the public. Businesses must identify and 
monitor the County Risk Level for the county the business is operating in and make 
required adjustments to their operations: 
•Purple – Widespread – Tier 1: Only outdoor operations are permitted. Outdoor
operations may be conducted under a tent, canopy, or other sun shelter as long
as no more than one side is closed, allowing sufficient outdoor air movement.
Outdoor pools can open. Outdoor hot tubs can open only for use by household
groups or in cases where six feet of distancing can be maintained. Indoor pools,
hot tubs, saunas, and steam rooms must remain closed. Gyms and fitness centers
must follow this guidance.
•Red – Substantial – Tier 2: Indoor operations are permitted but must be limited to
10% capacity. Indoor pools, hot tubs, saunas, and steam rooms must remain
closed. Gyms and fitness centers must follow this guidance.
•Orange – Moderate – Tier 3: Indoor operations are permitted but must be limited
to 25% capacity. Indoor pools can open when physical distancing can be
maintained for non-household groups. Indoor pools do not include any indoor
water parks or water rides. Indoor hot tubs, saunas, and steam rooms must
remain closed. Gyms and fitness centers must follow this guidance.
•Yellow – Minimal – Tier 4: Indoor operations are permitted but must be limited to
50% capacity. Indoor pools, hot tubs, saunas, and steam rooms can open but
physical distancing must be maintained for non-household groups. Indoor pools
do not include any indoor water parks or water rides. Gyms and fitness centers
must follow this guidance.
For the most updated information on county status, visit Blueprint for a Safer Economy. 
Please note that local health departments can have more restrictive criteria and 
different closures. Find your county’s local information. 
NOTE: Fitness facilities may have a number of operational aspects and service offerings 
available in other guidance on the Industry Guidance to Reduce Risk website. 
Operators must review and adhere to the modifications in the guidance. Such 
operations include: 
•Food service, snack or juice bars, and concessions (Restaurant guidance)
•Gift shops and retail operations (Retail guidance)
•Child care (Child Care guidance)
•Non-professional and amateur sports (Higher Education guidance)
•Youth sports (Youth Sports guidance)
•Outdoor recreation (Campgrounds, RV Parks, and Outdoor Recreation
guidance)
3
----------------Page (2) Break----------------
•Janitorial or custodial services (Limited Services guidance)
•Outdoor playgrounds (see CDPH Outdoor Playground guidance)
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related 
regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public 
health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA 
has more safety and health guidance on their Cal/OSHA Guidance on Requirements to 
Protect Workers from Coronavirus webpage. CDC has additional for businesses and 
employers. 
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. Complete details, 
including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be found in the 
guidance.  
The CDPH Face Covering Guidance is subject to additional updates based on the 
current scientific understanding of transmission of the virus causing COVID-19. Please 
check the CDPH website for any revisions.

----------------Page (3) Break----------------
Workplace Specific Plan 
•Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every
facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and
work tasks, and designate a person at each facility to implement the
plan.
•Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions.
•Identify contact information for the local health department where the
facility is located for communicating information about COVID-19
outbreaks among workers or patrons.
•Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives.
•Regularly evaluate the workplace for compliance with the plan and
document and correct deficiencies identified.
•Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as
needed to prevent further cases.
•Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a workplace has
an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines and orders or
guidance from the local health department.
•Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s) and
close contacts.
•Notify all employees in writing, and employers of subcontracted
employees, who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and report
workplace outbreaks to the local health department. For additional
information on employer responsibilities under AB 685 (Chapter 84,
Statutes of 2020), refer to the Enhanced Enforcement and Employer
Reporting Requirements from Cal/OSHA and the Employer Questions
about AB 685 from CDPH.
•For outdoor operations: Establish an effective heat illness prevention plan
with written procedures. See the Cal/OSHA heat illness prevention page
for resources, including FAQs, a webinar, and a sample written plan.
Elements of a heat illness prevent plan include:
oAccess to water
oAccess to shade
oCool down breaks
5
----------------Page (4) Break----------------
oEmergency procedures for heat illness cases
oMonitoring of employees who are acclimatizing during a heat wave
oTraining on heat illness prevention and symptoms
•Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited.
Topics for Worker Training 
•Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which
people are at higher risk for severe illness or death.
•Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks
using CDC guidelines.
•The importance of not coming to work:
oIf a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, such
as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,
fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell,
sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea,
OR
oIf a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been
released from isolation, OR
oIf, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered
potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation).
•To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only after
meeting CDPH Guidance on Returning to Work or School Following
COVID-19 Diagnosis.
•To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face.
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage.
•The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible
to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). Never use hand sanitizers with
methanol due to its high toxicity to both children and adults.
•The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time
(see Physical Distancing section below).
6
----------------Page (5) Break----------------
•Proper use of face coverings, including:
oFace coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE).
oFace coverings do not replace the need for physical distancing and
frequent handwashing.
oFace coverings must cover the nose and mouth.
oWorkers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or
adjusting face coverings.
oAvoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth.
oFace coverings must not be shared and should be washed or
discarded after each shift.
•Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings.
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled.
•Heat illness symptoms and prevention following Cal/OSHA requirements.
•Ensure independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at the
facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and
have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of
time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers.
•Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional
information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers’
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
•Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the
beginning of their shift and any vendors or contractors entering the
facility. Make sure the temperature/symptom screener avoids close
contact with workers to the extent possible.
•If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above.
7
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
•Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to
stay home.
•Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary.
•Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly
touched items.
•Workers who consistently must be within six feet of patrons or co-workers
must wear a secondary barrier (e.g., face shield or safety goggles) in
addition to a face covering. All employees should minimize the amount
of time spent within six feet of guests.
•Workers should wash hands on arrival at work, after working with each
fitness facility member, after touching their face covering, after using the
restroom, and when leaving work.
•If indoors, workers and patrons must wear face coverings at all times
except when showering or swimming where indoor pools are allowed to
open. Showering at home is encouraged where possible.
•The CDPH guidance exempts workers and patrons from wearing face
coverings while engaged in exercise outdoors, as long as they are able
to maintain a distance of at least six feet from others.
•If possible, implement a reservation system for the facility. Utilize the
reservation system to contact patrons with reservations 24 hours before
their scheduled arrival to confirm their reservation and ask if they or
someone in their household is exhibiting any COVID-19 symptoms. If the
patron answers in the affirmative the patron should be reminded that
they should only utilize the fitness facility if they do not pose a health risk to
other patrons or fitness facility workers. Such communication can be
done via app, email, or text, if possible. Consider limiting the duration of
use for patrons to accommodate more clients while maintaining
capacity restrictions.
•Remind patrons in advance to bring a face covering, otherwise they
should not be allowed to enter the premises unless exempted per the
CDPH Face Covering Guidance. Consider making face coverings
available for patrons who may arrive without them.
•Patrons should be temperature and/or symptom screened upon arrival
and asked to use hand sanitizer and to wear face coverings in
accordance with CDPH guidance. Operators have the right to cancel
reservations for individuals/parties with symptomatic patrons and refuse
entry.
8
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
•Fitness facilities must take reasonable measures, including posting
signage at all entrances and in strategic and highly-visible locations, to
remind workers and the public about the use of face coverings and the
importance of practicing physical distancing.
Ventilation, Cleaning, and Disinfecting 
Protocols  
•Where possible, install portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrade the
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and make other
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in
offices and other spaces.
•Check the CDPH website periodically for updates on indoor air quality
and ventilation guidance for airborne diseases in indoor settings.
•Evaluate the existing ventilation, cleaning, and disinfecting protocols for
the fitness facility, including reception areas, locker rooms, restrooms,
changing areas, and showers and update the protocols where
necessary. Fitness facilities should be prepared to:
oClean HVAC intakes and returns daily.
oDevelop a detailed schedule and adjust or modify operating hours
to provide adequate time for regular, thorough cleaning and
disinfecting throughout the day.
oPerform thorough cleaning throughout the day in high traffic areas,
such as reception and lobby areas, changing rooms, locker rooms,
and break rooms and areas of ingress and egress including stairways,
stairwells, escalators, handrails, and elevator controls.
oFrequently disinfect commonly used surfaces, including personal
exercise machines and equipment, countertops, vending machines,
doorknobs, and hand washing facilities.
oProvide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their
shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours
as part of the workers’ job duties.
oMake sure all workers have been trained to use and have an
adequate supply of all-purpose cleaners and disinfectants, when
needed. Follow the complete CDC guidelines for cleaning and
disinfection. Follow Cal/OSHA requirements and manufacturer
instructions for safe use and required personal protective equipment
for cleaning products.
oWorkers should have enough ventilation (air flow) in areas where
9
----------------Page (8) Break----------------
they are disinfecting. If cleaning in a bathroom or other small space, 
make sure the door and windows are propped open. 
oWorkers should be supplied with first aid supplies, including bandages
or other items to cover any cuts, scratches, or open wounds on skin
and have sufficient supply to change the bandages often.
oPatrons should be reminded to maintain six feet of distance from
janitorial or custodial workers. Implement a process to regularly
check in with workers to ensure visitors are following this protocol.
Ensure workers are able to share such information without fear of
reprisal or retaliation.
oProcure options for third-party cleaning companies to assist with the
increased cleaning demand, as needed.
•Equip entrances and exits, exercise machines, fitness rooms, changing
rooms and locker rooms, and other areas with proper sanitation products,
including hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes, and provide personal hand
sanitizers to workers who regularly engage with patrons (e.g., reception
workers).
•Require patrons to disinfect individual exercise equipment, mats, and
machines before and after use with provided disinfecting wipes. Ensure
that lined, non-touch trash receptacles are available throughout the
fitness facility to dispose of used wipes.
•If members are unable or unwilling to wipe/disinfect equipment after
exercise, provide “ready to clean” tags for members to place on
equipment after use, to ensure equipment is disinfected before the next
use.
•Consider implementing a check-out system for patrons to utilize any small
equipment and accessories (i.e. exercise bands, ropes, mats, foam rollers,
etc.). Develop a process to clean and disinfect these items upon return.
•Follow CDC guidelines to ensure that all water systems are safe to use
after a prolonged facility shutdown to minimize the risk of Legionnaires’
disease and other diseases associated with water.
•Wherever possible, install touchless, automatic water dispensers for use
with personal, reusable water bottles or single-use, disposable paper
cups. Display signage reminding workers and patrons that the bottle or
cup should not touch the water dispenser. If a touchless water dispenser
is not feasible, remind workers and patrons to wash their hands or use
proper hand sanitizer before and after touching the water release button
on drinking fountains.
•Encourage patrons to bring their own towels and mats and consider
disbanding the provision of any facility-provided towels or personal
10
----------------Page (9) Break----------------
hygiene products. 
•For any towels, cloth wipes, or other laundered items that are used at the
facility, follow CDC guidelines for those items. Provide a closed container
where patrons can place used towels or other items. Ensure those items
cannot be used again until properly laundered either by a commercial
laundering service or a laundering process which includes immersion in
water of at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 25 minutes. Store all
clean linens in a clean, covered place. Ensure workers who handle dirty
linens or laundry wear gloves.
•Workers and patrons should avoid shaking hands, bumping fists or elbows,
and should maintain physical distance unless unavoidable. Workers
should also avoid sharing tools, phones, electronics, and office supplies as
much as possible and, where feasible, ensure workers have dedicated
workstations for their personal use. Never share PPE.
•When choosing disinfecting chemicals, use products approved for use
against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-
approved list and follow product instructions. Use disinfectants labeled to
be effective against emerging viral pathogens, diluted household bleach
solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or alcohol solutions with at
least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the surface. Provide workers
training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer’s directions, ventilation
requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe use. Workers using
cleaners or disinfectants must wear gloves and other protective
equipment as required by the product. Follow the asthma-safer cleaning
methods recommended by the California Department of Public Health
and ensure proper ventilation.
•Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods that
can disperse pathogens into the air unless all persons in the area have
appropriate PPE. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter wherever possible.
•Place signage throughout the fitness facility emphasizing basic infection
prevention measures, including the importance of wearing face
coverings and frequent handwashing.
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
•WARNING: physical distancing alone is insufficient to prevent transmission
of COVID-19 and physical distances greater than six feet are
recommended for high-exertion activities.
•Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet
between and among workers and patrons. This can include use of
physical partitions or visual cues (e.g., floor markings, colored tape, or
signs to indicate to where workers and/or patrons should stand during
11
----------------Page (10) Break----------------
check-in at reception areas or when waiting to use equipment). 
•Space equipment at least six feet apart, with greater distancing for
treadmills and other high-exertion aerobic fitness equipment. Equipment
can be arranged in an “X” pattern to provide greater distancing.
Physical barriers can also be helpful to minimize exposure between
patrons or segregate exercise areas.
•Equip the front desk area with Plexiglas or other impermeable barriers, if
feasible, to minimize the interaction between reception workers and
patrons. Implement virtual, touchless check-in tools, if possible, so that
patrons do not have to utilize the reception space.
•Consider implementing special hours designated for high risk or
medically-vulnerable populations, including seniors with admittance by
reservation only.
•For outdoor operations, establish an outdoor reception area where
patrons can check in while still following physical distancing guidelines.
Take measures at reception desks or other areas where physical
distancing cannot be maintained to minimize exposure between workers
and customers, such as Plexiglas or other barriers.
•For outdoor operations, create outdoor break areas with shade covers
and seating that ensures physical distancing, where possible.
•Consider the following modifications to maintain physical distancing:
oImplementing an online reservation-based system, as suggested in
the Individual Control Measures and Screening section of this
document, to avoid patrons queuing in the facility or outside and
help maintain occupancy levels.
oPermitting only those patrons that are actually exercising inside the
facility. Patrons should not wait in the reception area.
oUsing one-way foot traffic patterns throughout the fitness facility with
visual cues and signs.
oStaggering available lockers in locker rooms to maintain physical
distancing.
oSpacing all equipment and machines at least six feet apart or taking
some out of service to achieve physical distancing.
oAdjusting personal training so that the exercise instructor maintains a
minimum of six feet of physical distance.
oModifying group training classes to limit the class size to ensure a
minimum of six feet of physical distance between patrons and/or
move the classes outdoors or to larger spaces like full-sized basketball
12
----------------Page (11) Break----------------
courts, if possible. Group exercise classes should only be offered if 
distancing requirements can be maintained and there is no person-
to-person physical contact. 
•High contact programs that require close contact less than six feet in
distance should be suspended. This would include activities such as
group sporting events, organized intermural activities, pick-up basketball,
or organized races.
•Adjust in-person meetings for workers, if they are necessary, to ensure
physical distancing and use virtual options or smaller meetings at facilities
to maintain physical distancing guidelines.
•Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that
minimize their contact with patrons and other workers (e.g., managing
administrative needs through telework).
•Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, to
maintain physical distancing protocols.
•Ensure workers can maintain physical distance in breakrooms, using
barriers, increasing distance between tables/chairs to separate workers,
etc. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade coverings
and seating arrangements that ensures physical distancing. Discourage
workers from congregating during breaks and ensure they are not eating
or drinking without face coverings within six feet of each other.
Additional Considerations for Communal 
Restrooms and Shower Facilities 
•Fitness facilities should consider staffing and other capacity and resource
needs to ensure that locker rooms and shower facilities can be cleaned
and disinfected regularly throughout the day.
•Shared restroom facilities and locker rooms should be cleaned regularly
throughout the day using EPA-registered disinfectants. High-touch
surfaces such as faucets, toilets, doorknobs, and light switches must be
frequently cleaned and disinfected.
•Create and post a cleaning schedule for the restroom facilities and
locker rooms. Post the cleaning schedule on the front of the door so
patrons know when they can/cannot use the restroom and/or locker
room. Make sure to close the restroom during the cleaning and
disinfecting process.
•Consider using a checklist or audit system to track how often cleaning is
conducted.
13
----------------Page (12) Break----------------
•Only allow shower and locker room use if partitions are in place or signs
have been posted to specify physical distancing requirements. If
partitions or proper distancing are not possible, these facilities should
remain closed.
•Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and are continuously
stocked at all times. Provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand
sanitizer when needed. Install hands-free devices, if possible, including
motion sensor sinks faucets, soap dispensers, sanitizer dispensers, and
paper towel dispensers.
•Consider modifying doors to multi-stall restrooms to be able to be opened
and closed without touching the handles, using opening-devices, or
powered door operators with the hand, whenever possible. If the door
cannot be opened without touching the handle or door-operator with
the hand, place a trash-receptacle by the door to ensure a paper towel
can be readily disposed of when operating the door. The location and
positioning of waste receptacles should not interfere with egress,
evacuation, emergency equipment, or any reasonable
accommodations provided under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Make sure trash cans are emptied regularly.
•Provide information on how to wash hands properly, including hanging
signs in restrooms.
Additional Considerations for Swimming Pools 
/ Aquatic Venues 
•Fitness facilities with swimming pools, splash pads, hot tubs, saunas, and
steam rooms must take additional steps to ensure those facilities are
properly cleaned and disinfected for patron use, according to CDC
guidelines.
•Facilities with an openly accessible outdoor hot tub must ensure that at
least six feet of distancing is maintained at all times between hot tub users
not from the same household or limit its use to one household group at a
time.
oPatrons should remove face coverings while they are in the hot tub,
due to the likelihood they will become wet, but must wear them as
required when outside of the hot tub.
oFacilities should provide a receptacle for collection of used towels for
laundry, and clean and disinfect high touch surfaces regularly.
oPost signage regarding distancing and face covering requirements.
14
----------------Page (13) Break----------------
oFacility staff must monitor compliance with distancing requirements
and, if it is not possible to consistently maintain distancing, must
discontinue use of the hot tub.
•Hot tub operations with individual, private outdoor hot tubs for hire must
limit their use to one household group at a time.
oPatrons should remove face coverings while they are in the hot tub,
due to the likelihood they will become wet, but must wear them as
required when outside of the hot tub.
oPost signage regarding face covering requirements.
oBetween hot tub uses, operators should collect any used towels for
laundry. Clean and disinfect high touch surfaces.
•For indoor pools, face coverings must be worn when out of the water or
shower areas, unless exempt from the CDPH guidance. Cloth face
coverings can be difficult to breathe through when they are wet. Face
coverings should be put away when not in use so they are not
accidentally touched or picked up by others.
•For outdoor pools, face coverings must be worn when out of the water,
unless exempt under the CDPH guidance.
•Maintain proper disinfectant levels (1-10 parts per million free chlorine or
3-8 ppm bromine) and pH (7.2-8).
•Consult with the company or engineer that designed the aquatic venue
to decide which List N disinfectants approved by the EPA are best for the
aquatic venue. Ensure the safe and correct use and storage of
disinfectants, including storing products securely away from children.
•Set up a system so that furniture and equipment (e.g., lounge chairs) that
needs to be cleaned and disinfected is kept separate from furniture that
has already been cleaned and disinfected. Label containers for used
equipment that has not yet been cleaned and disinfected and
containers for cleaned and disinfected equipment.
•Encourage patrons to bring and use their own towels wherever possible. If
the facility is providing them, launder towels according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Use the warmest appropriate water
temperature and dry items completely. Handle towels with disposable
gloves and minimal disturbance, i.e., do not shake them.
•Discourage people from sharing items, particularly those that are difficult
to clean and disinfect or those that are meant to come in contact with
the face (e.g., goggles, nose clips, and snorkels).
•Ensure that the facility has adequate equipment for patrons, such as kick
15
----------------Page (14) Break----------------
boards, pool noodles, and other flotation devices, to minimize sharing 
wherever possible. Clean and disinfect the items after each use. 
•For indoor aquatic venues, introduce and circulate outdoor air as much
as possible by opening windows and doors, using fans, or other methods.
However, do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety risk
to workers, patrons, or swimmers.
•Change the deck layout and other areas surrounding the pool to ensure
that the standing and seating areas can support physical distancing
requirements. This could include removing lounge chairs or taping off
areas to discourage use.
•Provide physical cues or guides (e.g., lane lines in the water or chairs and
tables on the deck) and visual cues (e.g., tape on the decks, floors, or
sidewalks) and signs to ensure that workers, patrons, and swimmers stay
at least six feet apart from one another, both in and out of the water.
•Where feasible, install impermeable physical barriers such as Plexiglas
where workers and patrons must interact and physical distancing is
difficult.
•Consider implementing reservations for pool use or implementing other
mechanisms to support physical distancing. This could include reserving
full-lanes for individual lap swimming, maintain swimmers in alternating
lanes, and half-lanes for individual household use.
•Ensure that lifeguards who are actively lifeguarding are not also
expected to monitor handwashing, use of cloth face coverings, or
physical distancing. Assign this monitoring responsibility to another worker.
•Aquatic venues should avoid activities that promote group gatherings
and should be aware of state and local policies on youth and adult
sports and gathering requirements to determine if aquatic fitness classes,
swim lessons, swim team practices, swim meets, or pool parties can be
held.
•CDC’s Model Aquatic Health Code has more recommendations to
prevent illness and injuries at public pools in parks.
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Fitness facilities must 
comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as 
guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California
