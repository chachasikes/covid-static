OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at 
home to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that 
may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with 
serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at 
higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when 
people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, 
even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not required)
and customers/clients,
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for campgrounds, RV parks, and outdoor recreation 
areas and operators/providers to support a safe, clean environment for the public, 
workers, interns and trainees, and volunteers. 
NOTE: Campgrounds with playgrounds, conference spaces, or meeting rooms 
should keep those areas closed until each of those types of establishments is 
allowed to resume modified or full operation. When allowed to reopen to 
modified or full operation, campgrounds and RV parks with these establishments 
should refer to guidance on such industries as it becomes available on the

COVID-19 Resilience Roadmap website. The guidance does not apply to youth 
camps, team or contact sports, school and educational activities, and other public 
gatherings. For guidance on day camps, refer to the guidance on the COVID-19 
Resilience Roadmap website. All public events or concentrated gatherings at 
campgrounds or RV parks, including group bonfires, group campsites, 
presentations at outdoor amphitheaters, musical or other performances, or other 
events must be cancelled or postponed until allowed to resume. Most organized 
activities and sports such as basketball, baseball, soccer, and football that are held 
on park fields, open areas, and courts are not permitted to the extent that they 
require coaches and athletes who are not from the same household or living unit 
to be in close proximity, which increases their potential for exposure to COVID-19. 
Members of the same household may engage in such activities and sports 
together. 
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include county 
health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related regulatory 
requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public health
guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. Cal/OSHA has 
more safety and health guidance on their Cal/OSHA Guidance on Requirements to 
Protect Workers from Coronavirus webpage. The California Department of Parks and 
Recreation has an online resource center for state parks and operational updates, 
including safety information, are available for national parks on the National Park Service 
webpage. CDC has additional guidance for parks and recreational facilities 
administrators. 
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution
to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
3

person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically 
distance; or, 
•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no
passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be found 
in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other circumstances, and 
employers can implement additional face covering requirements in fulfilling their 
obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. Employers must 
provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the reasonable cost of 
obtaining them. 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one of 
the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot wear 
one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if feasible, 
and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to wearing 
face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude any 
member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying with 
the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these exemptions 
among customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Workplace Specific Plan 
•Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at
every location and/or facility, perform a comprehensive risk assessment
of all work areas and work tasks, and designate a person at each area to
implement the plan. House all worksite-specific COVID-19 prevention
plans on a centralized database for reference and centralized access.
•Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions.
•Identify contact information for the local health department where the
facility is located for communicating information about COVID-19
outbreaks among workers or visitors.
•Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives
on the plan and make the plan available to workers and their
representatives.
•Regularly evaluate all areas for compliance with the plan and document
and correct deficiencies identified.
•Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan
as needed to prevent further cases.
•Implement the necessary processes and protocols to be when a
workplace has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines.
•Develop a process to implement quarantine measures for any
campground or RV park workers that live on-site.
•Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive worker(s)
and close contacts.
•Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace
illnesses that may cause a facility to be temporarily impacted or closed.
Topics for Worker Training 
•Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to
contracting the virus.
•Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks
using CDC guidelines.
•The importance of not coming to work:

oIf a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the CDC, such
as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,
fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell,
sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea,
OR
oIf a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been
released from isolation, OR
oIf, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with someone
who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is considered potentially
infectious (i.e. still on isolation).
•To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if
10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms
have improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of
fever reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without
symptoms who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only
if 10 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19
test.
•To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face.
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage.
•The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, including
scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer with at least
60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product is inaccessible
to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a sink or
handwashing station, per CDC guidelines).
•The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time
(see Physical Distancing section below).
•Proper use of face coverings, including:
oFace coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal
protective equipment (PPE).
oFace coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing.
oFace coverings must cover the nose and mouth.
oWorkers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or
adjusting face coverings.
oAvoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth.
oFace coverings must not be shared and should be washed or discarded
after each shift.

• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and 
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. 
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who 
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled. 
• Ensure any independent contracts, temporary or contract workers, or 
volunteers, including camp hosts, are also properly trained in COVID-19 
prevention policies and have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these 
responsibilities ahead of time with organizations supplying temporary 
and/or contract workers or volunteers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to receive 
that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional 
information on government programs supporting sick leave and workers’ 
compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave rights under 
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and workers’ rights to workers’ 
compensation benefits and presumption of the work-relatedness of 
COVID-19 pursuant to the Governor’s Executive Order N-62-20 while that 
Order is in effect. 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors or contractors entering the 
campground, RV park, or outdoor recreation facility. Make sure the 
temperature/symptom screener avoids close contact with workers to the 
extent possible. 
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to 
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed 
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC 
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. 
• Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to 
stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. 
• Employers  should  consider  where  disposable  glove  use  may  be  helpful  to 
supplement  frequent  handwashing  or  use  of  hand  sanitizer; examples  are 
for  workers  who  are screening  others for symptoms or  handling commonly 
touched items. 
• Employers must take reasonable measures to remind workers that they 
should use face coverings and frequently wash their hands with soap and

water or use hand sanitizer. 
• Contact visitors with reservations at campgrounds and RV parks before 
their scheduled arrival to confirm the reservation and ask if they or 
someone in their household is exhibiting any COVID-19 symptoms. If the 
visitor answers in the affirmative reschedule or cancel the reservation. 
• Campground and RV park operators should take steps to ensure visitors are 
fully aware of the park’s new policies and procedures prior to their arrival. 
Such policies should include the right for campground and RV park 
operators to cancel reservations for parties with symptomaticvisitors; new 
check-in procedures; physical distancing requirements; and cleaning and 
disinfecting schedules for accommodations, amenities, and common 
areas like the check-in/registration area and the park general store or 
visitor center. 
• Outdoor recreation operators should take steps to make the public aware 
of new protocols at the facilities. This could include using social media, 
website, texts, email, newsletters, etc., to communicate the steps being 
taken to protect visitors and workers so that they are familiar with updated 
policies (e.g. the use of face coverings and physical distancing 
requirements) before arriving at the facility. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Perform thorough cleaning on all high traffic areas such as guest check-in 
areas and lobbies, visitor centers, break rooms, restrooms, and areas of 
ingress and egress, including stairways and handrails, throughout the day. 
• Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces and items including golf 
cart or vehicle steering wheels and gear shifts, keys, tools, water 
spigots, trash receptacles, lounge chairs, shared equipment, 
doorknobs, countertops, toilets, and handwashing facilities. 
• Outdoor recreation operators should consult with equipment 
manufacturers to determine the appropriate disinfection steps, 
particularly for soft, porous surfaces. Encourage visitors to bring and 
use their own equipment wherever possible. 
• Equip guest reception and check-in areas and workstations with 
proper sanitation products, including hand sanitizer and disinfectant 
wipes. 
• Amenities, including trail maps, books, magazines, coffee, water, self-
serve stations (unless touchless), and other items for visitors, must be 
removed from reception areas to help reduce touch points and visitor 
interactions. Trail maps and other printed informational materials may 
be distributed to visitors on arrival for their individual use.

• Difficult to clean and commonly-touched items, including shared board 
games or books, should not be loaned out to visitors, if possible. Ifloaning 
out such items, consider placing returned items in a storage container for 
at least three days before loaning to a different visitor. 
• Follow CDC guidelines to ensure that all water systems are safe to use 
after a prolonged facility shutdown to minimize the risk of 
Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated with water. 
• Oftentimes restroom facilities without running water, such as portable 
toilets and vault toilets, are not stocked with hand hygiene products. 
Encourage visitors to be prepared to bring their own hand sanitizer with 
at least 60% ethanol or 70% isopropyl alcohol for use in these facilities. If 
provided, make sure portable handwashing stations are maintained and 
soap, towel, and water supplies are kept full. 
• Clean restroom facilities on an accelerated schedule to keep them 
clean and encourage campers and visitors to use them, thereby 
avoiding campers rejecting dirty and unsanitary restrooms and using the 
outdoors instead. Where possible, provide disposable seat covers in 
restrooms. 
• Encourage visitors to pack out what they pack in, wherever possible, to 
minimize the amount of trash workers must dispose of at the campsite, 
park, trailhead, or other facility. 
• Water filling stations, RV dump stations, and propane filling stations must 
be cleaned and disinfected each day and workers should wipe down 
the equipment after each use. If possible, place hand sanitizer near 
these facilities for visitor and worker use. 
• Workers should avoid sharing tools, phones, electronics, and office 
supplies as much as possible and, where feasible, ensure workers have 
dedicated workstations for their personal use. Never share PPE. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use product 
approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. Use 
disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, 
diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water),or 
alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate forthe 
surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, 
manufacturer’s directions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA 
requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should 
wear gloves and other protective equipment as required by the product. 
Follow the asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended by the 
California Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation. 
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their 
shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as

part of the worker’s job duties. Consider procuring third-party cleaning 
services where feasible and appropriate. 
• Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods 
that can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA 
filter wherever possible. 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners for offices or other 
workspaces, upgrading the building’s air filters to the highest efficiency 
possible, and making other modifications to increase the quantity of 
outside air and ventilation in offices and other spaces. 
• After each visitor stay, amenities at each site should be properly wiped 
down, cleaned, and disinfected. This includes BBQ grills, chairs, all 
secondary seating (e.g. swings or benches), water spigots, and RV 
electrical and water hook-ups. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between and among workers and visitors. This could include installing a 
Plexiglas barrier between workers and visitors in stores, lobbies, reception 
areas, or visitor centers or using visual cues to guide visitors where to stand 
or queue. Visitors should also be directed where to stand, using visual 
and/or verbal cues as appropriate, when waiting to use water filling 
stations, RV dump stations, propane filling stations, and other similar service 
locations. 
• Wherever possible, implement staggered worker shifts, work in assigned 
teams, vary arrival and departure, and stagger breaks in compliance with 
wage and hour regulations to avoid interaction or grouping among 
workers. 
• Avoid shaking hands, bumping fists or elbows, and other physical contact. 
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with visitors, customers, and other workers (e.g., 
managing inventory or managing administrative needs through telework). 
• Operators should monitor areas where people are likely to gather and 
ensure that physical distancing and other guidelines are followed. These 
areas might include sports fields, skateparks, basketball courts, tennis 
courts, trail heads, popular day use areas, and picnic areas. Post signs on 
physical distancing requirements and discourage groups from gathering in 
larger numbers than are currently recommended or allowed by the local 
county. 
• For facilities that provide paid, controlled outdoor activities, consider 
implementing a reservation system to limit the number of visitors at the 
10

facility. 
• Consider implementing remote check-in options for new arrivals at 
campgrounds or RV parks wherever possible. Post signs at the park’s 
entrance to communicate with visitors what they need to do upon arrival. 
List a phone number, for example, for visitors to contact rather than 
entering the registration area. Encourage the use of online payments, on-
site pay stations, credit card payment, or payment over the phone, where 
possible. 
• If remote check-in is not feasible, check-in visitors outside, if possible, and 
email receipts. Where necessary, escort or direct visitors directly to their site 
upon arrival following physical distancing requirements. Only one 
household should occupy each campsite or rental unit and non-registered 
visitors should not be permitted entry to the campground or RV park. 
• Consider implementing a process for visitors to pre-purchase items from the 
general store, including firewood, food items, or other goods, and have 
workers deliver items to the visitor’s campsite or RV. 
• Outdoor spaces intended for gatherings and group functions, including 
pavilions, communal fire rings, public-use camp kitchens, and 
amphitheaters should remain closed. Remove, separate, post closure signs, 
or tape-off all benches, common area picnic tables, and multi-person 
seating (including seating around fire pits) to discourage visitors from 
congregating. Playgrounds should also remain closed. 
• All public events and/or concentrated gatherings, including group 
bonfires, group campsites, presentations at outdoor amphitheaters, 
musical or other performances, or other events must be cancelled or 
postponed. 
• Smaller picnic shelters, such as those that typically accommodate only 
household groups, can remain open with posted physical distancing-
related restrictions (e.g., limit use to one household at a time). 
• Review campground and RV park sites to determine if the park needs to 
operate at a decreased capacity in order to maintain physical distancing. 
• Adjust any workers meetings to ensure physical distancing and use smaller 
individual meetings at facilities to maintain physical distancingguidelines. 
Hold meetings with workers over the phone, via webinar, or outdoors 
wherever possible. Consider virtual interviewing and on-boarding for new 
workers when possible.

Additional Considerations for Outdoor 
Recreation 
• Campground, RV park, and outdoor recreation operators should take 
steps to assess the risk inherent in the recreational activities that take 
place at their facilities. There are a number of actions operators can take 
to help lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure and reduce the spread 
during activity. The more person-to-person interaction, the closer the 
physical interaction, the more sharing of equipment there is by multiple 
participants, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-
19 spread. Therefore, risk of COVID-19 spread can be different, 
depending on the type of activity. Operators should take steps to ensure 
that higher risk activities, including those not yet recommended by CDC 
guidelines, are not occurring on their properties. 
• For most outdoor recreation activities, this guidance assumes that use of 
face coverings while playing or engaged in physical exercise may not 
be feasible. 
• Persons engaged in outdoor work or recreation activities, such as 
swimming, walking, hiking, bicycling, and running, are not required to 
wear face coverings, as long as they maintain a distance of at least six 
feet away from persons who are not members of the same household. 
Customers/guests/visitors should have face coverings with them and 
ready to put on when they cannot maintain physical distancing. 
• Evaluate the processes for renting and loaning recreational equipment 
and determine whether there is adequate workers capacity and 
available cleaning and disinfecting supplies to reopen such operations. 
All rented or shared equipment and items must be cleaned and 
disinfected between visitor use, including sports equipment, kayaks, surf 
or paddle boards, canoes, bikes, fishing gear, helmets, life vests, and 
other items. 
• Modify outdoor recreational activities, where necessary, to ensure proper 
cleaning and disinfecting protocols can be implemented. Such measures 
will be specific for the type of activity and the capacity of the facility but 
some examples include: 
o Encourage visitors to bring all of their own equipment, wherever 
possible, to minimize sharing of equipment. 
o Individual campsites should be occupied by members of the same 
household. 
o Remove all shared, on-site equipment that cannot be cleaned and 
disinfected between uses, where possible. This could include

removing the rakes from golf courses or chalk or writing utensils for 
posted scoreboards. Facility-provided games and equipment that 
are intended for communal use, e.g. horseshoe or cornhole sets at 
campgrounds or RV parks, should be removed. 
o At equine facilities, clean and disinfect gate latches, spray nozzles, 
cross tie snaps, pitchforks, wheelbarrows, and other frequently used 
items regularly or after contact with personnel. 
o For-hire fishing and small group charter operations must ensure 
customers have access to handwashing facilities or proper hand 
sanitizer on the vessel. 
o Clean and sanitize arrows before and after use at archery ranges. 
o Remove all score tenders at tennis and volleyball courts to prevent 
touching. Facilities should consider restricting tennis or volley balls to 
a particular group, court, or day of the week. This could include 
labeling them with a permanent marker. 
• Cleaning and disinfecting “soft goods,” such as life jackets, wetsuits, cotton 
lead ropes, saddle bags, or backpacks, poses particular challenges. Such 
equipment requires an effective cleaning procedure or sufficient 
equipment inventory to allow for sufficient “down time” of at least three 
days between uses to minimize risk of COVID-19 transmission. 
• High contact programs and sports that require close contact of less than 
six feet in distance between members of different households should be 
suspended. This includes activities such as group sporting events, pick-up 
basketball, intermural sports activities, races, or dances. 
• Limit high or close contact outdoor recreation activities to household units. 
This includes boat rentals, basketball and volleyball games, rope courses, 
and climbing walls. At campgrounds and RV parks, consider whether 
nature walks, movie nights, mini-golf, geocaching, scavenger hunts, or 
other activities can be developed for household units in a way that 
maintains physical distancing. 
• Modify outdoor recreational activities, where necessary, to allow for 
multiple households to utilize the facility or the equipment while 
maintaining physical distancing. Such modifications will be specific for 
each activity and depend on the capacity of the facility but some 
examples include: 
o Stagger tee times at golf courses and require one household per golf 
cart. 
o Limit the capacity on small group guided fishing, hunting, or 
chartered boat trips or reconfigure seating on boats or other vehicles. 
o Set up a schedule of access times to limit the capacity of people in a

barn or equine facility if demand requires scheduling to maintain 
physical distancing. 
• When outfitting people with helmets, gear, protective clothing, lifejackets, 
or other items, workers should maintain physical distance. Where possible, 
workers should demonstrate how to properly don and doff equipment 
rather than breaking physical distance to assist. 
• Campground, RV park, and outdoor recreation operators should review 
additional guidance on Family Entertainment Centers on the COVID-19 
Resilience Roadmap website. 
Additional Considerations for Communal 
Restroom and Shower Facilities 
• Campground, RV park, and outdoor recreation operators should consider 
staffing and other capacity and resource needs to ensure that shared, 
public restrooms can be cleaned and disinfected throughout the day. 
Maximum occupancy for the campground, RV park, or recreation area 
should be based on the number of fully-operational restrooms that the park 
operator can maintain and which can support physical distancing 
requirements. 
• Shared restroom facilities should be cleaned regularly using EPA-registered 
disinfectants throughout the day. High-touch surfaces such as faucets, 
toilets, doorknobs, and light switches must be frequently cleaned and 
disinfected. Workers should be trained on the hazards and proper use of 
new products per Cal/OSHA requirements, and be provided with any 
required protective equipment for the specific cleaning products in use, 
such as eye protection or gloves. 
• Create and post a cleaning schedule in every open restroom facility. Post 
the cleaning schedule on the front of the door so visitors know when they 
can/cannot use the restroom. Make sure to close the restroom during the 
cleaning and disinfecting process. 
• Consider using a checklist or audit system to track how often cleaning is 
conducted. 
• Only allow shower room use if partitions are in place or signs have been 
posted to specify physical distancing requirements. If partitions orproper 
distancing are not possible, these facilities should remain closed. 
• Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and are continuously stocked 
at all times. Provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer 
when needed. Install hands-free devices, if possible, including motion 
sensor sinks, faucets, soap dispensers, sanitizer dispensers, and paper towel

dispensers. 
• Doors to multi-stall restrooms should be able to be opened and closed 
without touching the handles, opening-devices, or powered door 
operators with the hand, whenever possible. If the door cannot be opened 
without touching the handle or door-operator with the hand, prop the 
door open and/or place a trash-receptacle by the door to ensure a paper 
towel can be readily disposed of when operating the door. The location 
and positioning of waste receptacles should not interfere with egress, 
evacuation, emergency equipment, or any reasonable accommodations 
provided under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Make sure trash cans 
are emptied regularly. 
• Campground, RV park, and outdoor recreation visitors should be instructed 
that sinks could be an infection source and should avoid placing 
toothbrushes and other items directly on counter surfaces. Totes could also 
be used for personal items to limit their contact with other surfaces in the 
restroom. 
• Campground and RV park management should encourage guests staying 
in vehicles with toilets and showers/bathing equipment to use their own 
facilities rather than shared ones, if possible. 
• Provide information on how to wash hands properly, including hanging 
signs in restrooms. 
Additional Considerations for Swimming Pools 
and Aquatic Venues 
• Campground, RV park, and outdoor recreation operators with swimming 
pools and splash pads should take additional steps to ensure those facilities 
are properly cleaned and disinfected for visitor use, according to CDC 
guidelines. 
• Campgrounds, RV parks, and outdoor recreation operators that have 
swimming pools which include water slides, water rides, or other water 
attractions must keep those areas closed until such operations can resume. 
Swimming pools themselves can remain open. 
• Please note that saunas, steam rooms, and hot tubs should remain closed 
until such operations can resume. 
• For indoor pools, face coverings must be work when out of the water or 
shower areas, unless exempt from the CDPH guidance. Cloth face 
coverings can be difficult to breathe through when they are wet. Face 
coverings should be put away when not in use so they are not accidentally 
touched or picked up by others.

• For outdoor pools, face coverings must be worn when out of the water 
whenever six-foot physical distancing cannot be maintained, unless 
exempt under the CDPH guidance. 
• Maintain proper disinfectant levels (1-10 parts per million free chlorine or 3-8 
ppm bromine) and pH (7.2-8). 
• Consult with the company or engineer that designed the aquatic venue to 
decide which List N disinfectants approved by the EPA are best for the 
aquatic venue. Ensure the safe and correct use and storage of 
disinfectants, including storing products securely away from children. 
• Set up a system so that furniture and equipment (e.g., lounge chairs) that 
need to be cleaned and disinfected are kept separate from furniture that 
has already been cleaned and disinfected. Label containers for used 
equipment that has not yet been cleaned and disinfected and containers 
for cleaned and disinfected equipment. 
• Encourage visitors to bring and use their own towels. If towels are provided, 
launder them and clothing according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Use the warmest appropriate water temperature and dry items 
completely. Handle towels with disposable gloves and minimal 
disturbance, i.e., do not shake them. 
• Discourage people from sharing items, particularly those that are difficult to 
clean and disinfect or those that are meant to come in contact with the 
face (e.g., goggles, nose clips, and snorkels). 
• Ensure that the facility has adequate equipment for patrons, such as kick 
boards, pool noodles, and other flotation devices, to minimize sharing 
wherever possible. Limit the use of the equipment to one patron at a time 
and clean and disinfect the items after each use. 
• For indoor aquatic venues, introduce and circulate outdoor air as much as 
possible by opening windows and doors, using fans, or other methods. 
However, do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety risk to 
workers, visitors, or swimmers. 
• Change the deck layout and other areas surrounding the pool to ensure 
that the standing and seating areas can support physical distancing 
requirements. This could include removing lounge chairs or taping off areas 
to discourage use. 
• Provide physical cues or guides (e.g., lane lines in the water or chairs and 
tables on the deck) and visual cues (e.g., tape on the decks, floors, or 
sidewalks) and signs to ensure that workers, visitors, and swimmers stay at 
least six feet apart from one another, both in and out of the water. 
• Where feasible, install impermeable physical barriers such as Plexiglas 
where workers and patrons must interact and physical distancing isdifficult.

• Consider implementing reservations for pool use or implementing other 
mechanisms to support physical distancing. This could include reserving full-
lanes for individual lap swimming and half-lanes for individual household 
use. 
• Ensure that lifeguards who are actively lifeguarding are not also expected 
to monitor handwashing, use of cloth face coverings, or physical 
distancing. Assign this monitoring responsibility to another worker. 
• Aquatic venues should avoid activities that promote group gatherings and 
should be aware of local policies on gathering requirements to determine 
if aquatic fitness classes, swim lessons, swim team practices, swim meets, or 
pool parties can be held. 
• CDC’s Model Aquatic Health Code has more recommendations to 
prevent illness and injuries at public pools in parks. 
Additional Considerations for Cabins and Rental 
Units 
• Campgrounds and RV parks with cabins or other rental units should take 
the proper steps to clean and disinfect those areas after each use. This 
includes wiping down and cleaning bed rails, tables, TV remotes, 
headboards, countertops, kitchen appliances, refrigerator handles, stove 
knobs, mirrors, and other items. 
• All linens must be removed and laundered between each visitor stay, 
including items that appear to not have been used. When cleaning 
bedding, towels, or other laundered items in rental units, ensure workers 
wear disposable gloves when handling dirty laundry and then discard after 
each use. Wash hands with soap or use hand sanitizer immediately after 
gloves are removed. Do not store extra linens in the rental unit. Provide 
such items only on request. 
• Do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus 
through the air. Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest 
appropriate water setting for the items and dry items 
completely. Clean and disinfect laundry hampers according to guidance 
above for surfaces. If possible, consider placing a bag liner that is either 
disposable and thrown away after each use or can be laundered after 
each use. 
• Kitchen items, including pots, pans, and utensils, must be thoroughly 
cleaned with soap and hot water, preferably in a dishwasher, between 
each visitor stay. Provide adequate dish soap and new, unused sponges 
for each visitor upon arrival. Consider replacing utensils with one-time use

dinnerware, if feasible. 
• Consider instituting a 24-hour waiting period after a visitor checks out 
before cleaning any campground-owned accommodations, including 
rental units. 
• Any rental unit intended for large gatherings, including conferences or 
meetings, should not be opened until such operations can resume. 
• Additional guidance for the Hotel and Lodging industry is available on the 
COVID-19 Resilience Roadmap website. 
Additional Considerations for Food and Dining 
• Dine-in restaurants, bars, snack bars, and other concessions must be run in 
accordance with current orders and guidelines for such establishments on 
the COVID-19 Resilience Roadmap website. All self-service food stations 
should be closed, including coffee machines, soda fountains, or toasters. 
• Where possible, visitors should order food items online or over the phone 
and food should be available for pick-up. Walk-up snack bars or 
concession services should be available for pick-up of pre-ordered items. If 
pre-ordering is not available, ensure visitors maintain physical distancing 
when ordering food items. 
• Snack bars and concessionaires should sell pre-packed and individually 
wrapped food wherever possible. Wrap silverware or plasticware 
individually within a napkin so people are not picking them out of a group 
of utensils in a basket, cup, or box. 
• Encourage the use of credit cards or accept payment over the phone, if 
possible, for food items. 
• Outdoor recreation operators should not hold potlucks or similar family-
style eating and drinking events that increase the risk of cross 
contamination. If food and beverages must be served or shared, provide 
items in single-serve, disposable containers whenever possible. Workers or 
volunteers serving food should wash hands frequently and wear disposable 
gloves.

Additional Considerations for Campground and 
RV Park Laundry Facilities 
• If necessary, adjust the operating hours for laundry room facilities to ensure 
that workers have adequate time to frequently clean and disinfect the 
laundry machine lids and doors, lint screens, tabletops and counters, chairs 
or benches, soap dispensers, vending machines, change machines, sinks, 
and other areas. 
• Consider placing hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes in the laundry room 
so visitors can wipe down the area before/after they use the machines. 
• Remove all games, books, brochures, or other items from the laundry 
facilities. Remove laundry baskets or bins, if provided. 
• Consider developing an appointment-type system for the laundry facilities 
so that workers know when the facilities are being used and visitors can 
avoid unnecessary interaction. Keep the laundry facilities locked between 
scheduled appointments to ensure adequate time for cleaning. 
• If not possible to implement an appointment-type system, maintain 
physical distancing by closing every other machine so that six feet of 
physical distance can be maintained between visitors. Encourage visitors 
to wait outdoors while laundry is being washed/dried. Alternatively, use 
visual cues to direct visitors where to stand and limit access so individual 
visitors can use multiple machines that are together. Determine what the 
maximum capacity should be for the room size and post a sign on the door 
that states how many individuals can be in the room at one time, along 
with the cleaning and disinfecting schedules. 
Additional Considerations for Ground and 
Building Maintenance 
• Make sure all workers have been trained to use and have an adequate 
supply of all-purpose cleaners and disinfectants, when needed. Follow the 
complete CDC guidelines for cleaning and disinfection. 
• Clean touchable surfaces between shifts or between users, whichever is 
more frequent, including but not limited to working surfaces, tools, handles 
and latches, and controls on stationary and mobile equipment, including 
surfaces in the cabs of all vehicles. 
• Minimize or eliminate use of shared equipment and tools. If tools are 
shared, disinfect between each use, according to CDC guidelines.

Disinfect all tools at the end of the work day. 
• Require workers to wash hands or use hand sanitizer between the use of 
shared equipment, such as workstation tools, radios, mobilized carts,and 
other items. 
• Janitorial or custodial workers must be told if they are going to be working 
in a location where an infected person has been. Qualified third-party 
qualified cleaning services are recommended for decontamination of 
affected areas. 
• Any area where an infected person has been must be closed and 
ventilated for 24 hours, if possible, before workers can enter for cleaning. If 
not possible, ventilate the area for the maximum time possible, but never 
less than 3 hours. Alternatively, any contaminated area where access can 
be effectively restricted can be closed for seven days to let the virus die. 
• If janitorial or custodial workers are asked to disinfect an area withknown 
COVID-19 cases, they must not start operations until the campground or RV 
operator has provided the proper protective equipment and hazard 
training, or a refresher training. Janitorial or custodial workers must wear 
disposable gloves for all tasks in the cleaning process, including handling 
trash. Workers should be reminded to wash hands with soap and water 
immediately after taking off the gloves, or use hand sanitizer. Additional 
PPE might be required, including eye goggles, based on the 
cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of 
splash. Janitorial workers must be provided training and information on the 
hazards of cleaners and disinfectants used, the availability of the safety 
data sheets, PPE required, and ventilation required. 
• Workers should have enough ventilation (air flow) in areas where they are 
cleaning. If cleaning in a bathroom or other small space, make sure the 
door and windows are propped open. 
• To reduce the risk of asthma related to disinfecting, programs should aim to 
select disinfectant products on the N list with asthma-safer ingredients 
(hydrogen peroxide, citric acid or lactic acid). Avoid products that mix 
these ingredients with peroxyacetic acid, sodium hypochlorite (bleach) or 
quaternary ammonium compounds, which can cause asthma. Follow the 
asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended by the California 
Department of Public Health. 
• Workers conducting cleaning should be supplied with first aid supplies, 
including bandages or other items to cover any cuts, scratches, or open 
wounds on skin and have sufficient supply to change the bandages often. 
• Campground and RV park visitors must be reminded to maintain six-feet of 
distance from maintenance, janitorial, or custodial workers on the 
maintenance team. Implement a process to regularly check in with 
workers to ensure visitors are following this protocol. Ensure workers are able

to share such information without fear of reprisal or retaliation. 
• Campground and RV park operations should evaluate if the dog park on 
the grounds is large enough to accommodate visitors and their animals 
while maintaining proper physical distancing. If the space is not sufficient, 
dog parks must be expanded, occupancy-limited, or closed. 
• Ground crews and building workers should refer to additional guidance on 
limited services available on the COVID-19 Resilience Roadmap website. 
Additional Considerations for Visitors 
• When camping or engaging in outdoor recreation, visitors should make 
sure they plan ahead. When possible, visitors should make reservations and 
purchase permits, firewood, ice and other items online or by phone before 
arriving on site. Cash-less and minimal-contact transactions are becoming 
a common operating procedure in many establishments to avoid lines and 
person-to-person interactions. This will help protect visitors and workers. 
• Visitors should be prepared to be as self-contained and self-sufficient as 
possible. For example, arrive prepared with your own soap, surface 
disinfectant supplies, hand sanitizer, paper towels/hand towels, and toilet 
paper. It is also advisable to bring disinfecting wipes to clean up before 
and after use of common facilities. Bring your own sports equipment, 
towels, first aid supplies, and other items needed for outdoor recreation 
whenever possible. Visitors should bring plastic table cloths for picnic tables 
that can be disposed of or taken back home for washing. 
• To ensure physical distancing can be maintained, visitors should set up their 
campsite or picnic areas to maximize distance from adjacent campsites 
and picnic sites that host people from different households. 
• Visitors should be prepared to follow all rules and updated policies at 
campgrounds, RV parks, and other outdoor recreational areas, including 
public parks, walking trails, and marinas. These new rules and policies could 
include: 
o Come to the park or facility prepared. Many programs and facilities will 
be canceled or closed, so visitors should check online resources for 
updated information about rule changes and closures to know what to 
expect upon arrival. For example, some outdoor recreation areas may 
not open immediately due to the time required for gates to be 
unlocked, sites to be serviced, and potential for crowding. 
o Observe all cleaning protocols for self-service facilities and amenities 
before using them. 
o Leave furniture, such as picnic tables and chairs, as they were found as 
park workers may have appropriately spaced these items to

encourage physical distancing. 
o Follow directional signage – e.g., wait your turn and abide by capacity 
limits – that will promote physical distancing in buildings, at overlooks, 
and around other confining spaces. 
o Plan your travel in a safe and responsible way. Be mindful that 
backcountry and rescue operations require many emergency 
responders and extra demands on those healthcare resources puts 
everyone at risk. 
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Campgrounds, RV 
parks, and outdoor recreation operators must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be 
prepared to adhere to its guidance as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, 
employers must be prepared to alter their operations as those guidelines change.
