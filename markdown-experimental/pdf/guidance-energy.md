OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at home 
to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that may 
result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with serious 
underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at higher 
risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when people 
are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, even if that 
person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available at 
this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating that 
workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of these 
workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible, 
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not 
required) and customers/clients, 
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection, 
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention 
plan. 
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for the energy and utilities industry to support a safe, 
clean environment for workers. 
NOTE: Employers engaged in construction of energy and utilities infrastructure 
should also refer to the guidelines for construction employers available on the 
COVID-19 Resilience Roadmap website. 
The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either statutory, 
regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not include 
county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-related

regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on changes to public 
health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 situation continues. 
Cal/OSHA has more comprehensive guidance on their Cal/OSHA General Guidelines 
on Protecting Workers from COVID-19 webpage. CDC has additional guidance for 
businesses and employers. 
Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or distribution
to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance;
•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When no
passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering requirements 
in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful workplace. 
Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers for the 
reasonable cost of obtaining them. 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one of 
the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot 
wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if 
feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. 
3
----------------Page (2) Break----------------
 
  
 
    
 
    
  
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude 
any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying 
with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these 
exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Worksite Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, workplace-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every 
location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and 
work tasks, and designate a person at each establishment to implement 
the plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
operation is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers or customers. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the establishment for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as 
needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a 
workplace has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive 
worker(s) and close contacts. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
Strategic Operation Plan 
• Identify whether decisions to increase/suspend/reduce operations at key 
accounts will impact load balancing. 
• Determine whether the organization has identified facilities critical to the 
operation of the energy grid and has made accommodations for 
sequestering at those facilities (on-site food/water/hygiene/medical, 
family services, personal protective equipment, etc.). 
• Develop a plan and process to prioritize work in areas involving exposure 
to hazardous substances, including prioritization of work orders and

requests and response times for leaks. 
• Implement or expand programs that provide utility assistance such as 
the low-income home energy assistance program or similar methods 
that provide financial assistance for home air conditioner use. 
Topics for Worker Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to 
contracting the virus. 
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks 
using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work: 
o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the 
CDC, such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, 
new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, 
nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR 
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with 
someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is 
considered potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 
10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms 
have improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of 
fever reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without 
symptoms who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only 
if 10 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 
test. 
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
• The  importance  of  frequent  handwashing  with  soap  and  water, 
including scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer 
with at least 60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product 
is inaccessible to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a 
sink or handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time

(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not 
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or discarded 
after each shift. 
• Information contained in the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face 
Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and 
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. 
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who 
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled. 
• Ensure any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at 
the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and 
have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of 
time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to 
receive that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See 
additional information on government programs supporting sick leave 
and workers’ compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave 
rights under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and workers’ 
rights to workers’ compensation benefits and presumption of the work-
relatedness of COVID-19 pursuant to the Governor’s Executive Order N-
62-20 while that Order is in effect.

Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any personnel entering the facility. Non-
workers entering the facility should be restricted to only those classified 
as essential by management and they must complete a temperature 
and/or symptom screening before entering. Make sure the 
temperature/symptom screener avoids close contact with workers to the 
extent possible. 
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to 
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed 
prior to the worker leaving the home for their shift and follows CDC 
guidelines, as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. 
• Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to 
stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful to 
supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; examples are 
for workers who are screening others for symptoms or handling commonly 
touched items. 
• Provide the necessary equipment and accommodations for line crews 
that may need to respond to grid disruption, including all required safety 
equipment for crews operating in areas with high numbers of infections. 
• Conduct daily safety briefings prior to field workers going on service calls 
and develop internal communications that can be regularly updated on 
the use of PPE and other mitigation requirements. 
Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Perform thorough cleaning in high traffic areas, such as break rooms, 
lunch areas, and changing areas, and areas of ingress and egress, 
including stairways and stairwells, handrails, and elevator controls. 
Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces, including doorknobs, toilets, 
and handwashing facilities. 
• Clean touchable surfaces between shifts or between users, whichever is 
more frequent, including but not limited to working surfaces, tools, 
handles and latches, and controls on stationary, hand-held, and

mobile equipment (including surfaces in the cabs of vehicles, two-way 
radios, gas detectors, electricity meters, and controls in aerial lift 
buckets). 
• Avoid sharing phones, handheld mobile communications, office supplies, 
other work tools, or equipment wherever possible. Individually-assigned 
peripheral equipment (keyboards, handsets, headsets, chairs, etc.) 
should be provided wherever possible. Never share PPE. 
• Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times 
and provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when 
needed. Provide additional sanitary facilities if several workers need to 
take use the restroom at the same time, e.g., during scheduled breaks. 
• To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases 
associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and 
features are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown. 
• Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their 
shift. Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as 
part of the worker’s job duties. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use products 
approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. Use 
disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, 
diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), 
or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the 
surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, 
manufacturer’s directions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA 
requirements for safe use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should 
wear gloves and other protective equipment as required by the product 
instructions. Follow the asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended 
by the California Department of Public Health and ensure proper 
ventilation. 
• For those field technicians using such equipment, require that hard hats 
and face shields be sanitized at the end of each shift. Clean the inside of 
the face shield, then the outside, then wash hands. Provide hand sanitizer 
to all field staff. 
• Where possible, do not clean floors by sweeping or other methods 
that can disperse pathogens into the air. Use a vacuum with a HEPA 
filter wherever possible. 
• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the 
building’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making 
other modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and

ventilation in offices and other spaces. 
• Modify offerings in on-site cafeterias, including using prepackaged foods, 
and safe options for drink, condiment, and flatware dispensing. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between workers. These can include use of physical partitions or visual 
cues (e.g., floor markings or signs to indicate where workers should 
stand). 
• Develop a process workflow with questions and talking points for 
workers to use at the customer’s door to identify suspected COVID-19 
concerns. The workflow will give workers the flexibility to gauge the 
situation when the response requires entering a home/building. 
• Contact customers before visits to confirm appointments and check if 
there are infected people on premises; check again when workers are at 
the door. Request customers use face coverings during the visit and 
maintain safe distancing of at least six feet from workers. 
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with customers and other workers (e.g., 
managing inventory rather than working as a cashier or managing 
administrative needs through telework). 
• Allow field personnel to call a “safety stop” when they are reluctant to 
enter a dwelling or other building. A field worker should call a supervisor 
and discuss what work is essential to complete immediately and proper 
precautions to take. 
• Limit exposure for field technicians and personnel by implementing 
remote diagnostics and self-install/repair strategies, e.g., support 
through video calls and instruction videos, wherever possible. 
• Adjust safety meetings to ensure physical distance and implement 
smaller safety meetings at facilities to maintain physical distancing 
guidelines. 
• Transition all meetings and interviews to phone or virtual platforms or hold 
outside or in a space allowing for at least six feet of physical distance 
between workers. 
• Utilize work practices, when feasible, to limit the number of workers on-
site at one time. This may include scheduling (e.g., staggering shift 
start/end times) or rotating access to a designated area during a shift.

Stage facilities to stagger work and limit overlap of work crews. Place 
additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas to 
ensure at least six feet of separation to limit transmission of the virus. 
• Where physical distancing cannot be maintained, crews responding to 
outages or other service calls should drive separate vehicles if feasible. If 
not feasible, require that workers keep the cab well ventilated and do 
not reassign or comingle crew members. 
• Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour 
regulations, to maintain physical distancing protocols. 
• Close breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance between 
tables/chairs to separate workers and discourage congregating during 
breaks. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade covers 
and seating that ensures physical distancing. 
• Designate separate entrances and exits and post signage to this effect. 
• Reassign lockers or limit or stagger locker use to increase distance 
between workers. 
• Information and communications technology resources should be 
appropriate to accommodate increased use of remote work 
arrangements consistent with business continuity plans, without 
compromising security. Consider conducting planned stress tests for 
these arrangements. 
• For field workers operating in a restricted area or containment zone, 
organizations should consider: 
o Offering alternate lodging, such as mobile homes and RVs equipped 
with washer/dryers, showers, and kitchens. 
o Dividing workers into small teams and keeping those teams 
separated with assigned vehicles and different base camp/staging 
area locations. Consider rental options to keep the number of workers in a 
single vehicle low. 
o Instituting triple wellness checks with mandatory temperature and/or 
symptom screenings at arrival, at mid-shift, and when going off-duty, 
with a health survey.

Additional Considerations for Protecting 
Control Centers 
• Identify essential workers to develop effective strategies for mitigating 
their risk of infection. Develop a plan if they need to be removed from 
the workforce. 
• Crews on shift work schedules should be segregated. System 
operators should be split (days/nights or split individual shifts) 
between primary and backup control centers. Operating night 
shifts and day shifts in different locations will provide a 12-hour 
window between occupation to allow for enhanced cleaning. 
• Outside visitors should not be allowed in control centers (e.g., no 
tours or non-essential personnel from the same organization). 
• Consider which, if any, personnel can perform their jobs in spaces 
adjacent to an existing control room. 
• In any scenario where a shift of control center personnel is not in the 
same room, the lines of communication between workers should 
remain open, clear, and easily accessible. 
• Workstations should allow for at least six feet of space between 
workers. Take into account room design and other physical space 
limitations, including the placement of wiring that may restrict 
options for where workstations can be located. Physical barriers 
between workers can be used for additional protection when six 
feet of distance is not possible. 
• Contractors/vendors should be screened with a health 
questionnaire and/or temperature check before being allowed 
onsite for deliveries, repairs, etc. Access should be limited to critical 
activities only. 
• Consider control room functions that can be performed remotely, 
like monitoring or data analytics. 
• Control center support staff (engineering, transmission scheduling, 
compliance, etc.) should be allowed to work remotely (e.g., VPN) 
to the extent permissible. 
• Logistics plans for housing operators onsite, including bedding, 
hygiene facilities, entertainment, and food accommodations, 
should be developed.

1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. The energy and utilities 
industry must comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance 
as well as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the 
California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers should be prepared to 
alter their operations as those guidelines change.
