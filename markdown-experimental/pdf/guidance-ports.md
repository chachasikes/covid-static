OVERVIEW 
On March 19, 2020, the State Public Health Officer and Director of the California 
Department of Public Health issued an order requiring most Californians to stay at 
home to disrupt the spread of COVID-19 among the population. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the health of Californians is not yet fully known. Reported 
illness ranges from very mild (some people have no symptoms) to severe illness that 
may result in death. Certain groups, including people aged 65 or older and those with 
serious underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, are at 
higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications. Transmission is most likely when 
people are in close contact or in a poorly ventilated area with an infected person, 
even if that person does not have any symptoms or has not yet developed symptoms. 
Precise information about the number and rates of COVID-19 by industry or 
occupational groups, including among critical infrastructure workers, is not available 
at this time. There have been multiple outbreaks in a range of workplaces, indicating 
that workers are at risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19 infection. Examples of 
these workplaces include hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, food production, 
warehouses, meat processing plants, and grocery stores. 
As stay-at-home orders are modified, it is essential that all possible steps be taken to 
ensure the safety of workers and the public. 
Key prevention practices include: 
✓physical distancing to the maximum extent possible,
✓use of face coverings by workers (where respiratory protection is not
required) and customers/clients,
✓frequent handwashing and regular cleaning and disinfection,
✓training workers on these and other elements of the COVID-19 prevention
plan.
In addition, it will be critical to have in place appropriate processes to identify new 
cases of illness in workplaces and, when they are identified, to intervene quickly and 
work with public health authorities to halt the spread of the virus. 
PURPOSE 
This document provides guidance for ports to support a safe, clean environment for 
workers. The guidance is not intended to revoke or repeal any worker rights, either 
statutory, regulatory or collectively bargained, and is not exhaustive, as it does not 
include county health orders, nor is it a substitute for any existing safety and health-
related regulatory requirements such as those of Cal/OSHA.1 Stay current on 
changes to public health guidance and state/local orders, as the COVID-19 
situation continues. Cal/OSHA has additional safety and health guidance on their 
Cal/OSHA COVID-19 Infection Prevention for Logistics Employers and Workers 
webpage. CDC has more requirements in their guidance for businesses and 
employers and specific guidance for mail and parcel delivery.

Required Use of Face Coverings 
On June 18, CDPH issued Guidance on the Use of Face Coverings, which broadly 
requires the use of face coverings for both members of the public and workers in all 
public and workplace settings where there is a high risk of exposure. 
People in California must wear face coverings when they are engaged in work, 
whether at the workplace or performing work off-site, when: 
•Interacting in-person with any member of the public;
•Working in any space visited by members of the public, regardless of whether
anyone from the public is present at the time;
•Working in any space where food is prepared or packaged for sale or
distribution to others;
•Working in or walking through common areas, such as hallways, stairways,
elevators, and parking facilities;
•In any room or enclosed area where other people (except for members of the
person’s own household or residence) are present when unable to physically
distance;
•Driving or operating any public transportation or paratransit vehicle, taxi, or
private car service or ride-sharing vehicle when passengers are present. When
no passengers are present, face coverings are strongly recommended.
Complete details, including all requirements and exemptions to these rules, can be 
found in the guidance. Face coverings are strongly encouraged in other 
circumstances, and employers can implement additional face covering 
requirements in fulfilling their obligation to provide workers with a safe and healthful 
workplace. Employers must provide face coverings to workers or reimburse workers 
for the reasonable cost of obtaining them. 
Employers should develop an accommodation policy for any worker who meets one 
of the exemptions from wearing a face covering. If a worker who would otherwise be 
required to wear a face covering because of frequent contact with others cannot 
wear one due to a medical condition, they should be provided with a non-restrictive 
alternative, such as a face shield with a drape attached to the bottom edge, if 
feasible, and if the medical condition permits it. 
Businesses that are open to the public should be cognizant of the exemptions to 
wearing face coverings in the CDPH Face Covering Guidance and may not exclude 
any member of the public for not wearing a face covering if that person is complying 
with the guidance. Businesses will need to develop policies for handling these 
exemptions among customers, clients, visitors, and workers.

Worksite Specific Plan 
• Establish a written, worksite-specific COVID-19 prevention plan at every 
location, perform a comprehensive risk assessment of all work areas and 
work tasks, and designate a person at each establishment to implement 
the plan. 
• Incorporate the CDPH Face Covering Guidance into the Workplace 
Specific Plan and include a policy for handling exemptions. 
• Identify contact information for the local health department where the 
operation is located for communicating information about COVID-19 
outbreaks among workers or customers. 
• Train and communicate with workers and worker representatives on the 
plan and make the plan available to workers and their representatives. 
• Regularly evaluate the establishment for compliance with the plan and 
document and correct deficiencies identified. 
• Investigate any COVID-19 illness and determine if any work-related 
factors could have contributed to risk of infection. Update the plan as 
needed to prevent further cases. 
• Implement the necessary processes and protocols when a 
workplace has an outbreak, in accordance with CDPH guidelines. 
• Identify close contacts (within six feet for 15 minutes or more) of an 
infected worker and take steps to isolate COVID-19 positive 
worker(s) and close contacts. 
• Adhere to the guidelines below. Failure to do so could result in workplace 
illnesses that may cause operations to be temporarily closed or limited. 
Topics for Worker Training 
• Information on COVID-19, how to prevent it from spreading, and which 
underlying health conditions may make individuals more susceptible to 
contracting the virus. 
• Self-screening at home, including temperature and/or symptom checks 
using CDC guidelines. 
• The importance of not coming to work: 
o If a worker has symptoms of COVID-19 as described by the 
CDC, such as a fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or

difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, 
new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, 
nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, OR 
o If a worker was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not yet been 
released from isolation, OR 
o If, within the past 14 days, a worker has had contact with 
someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is 
considered potentially infectious (i.e. still on isolation). 
• To return to work after a worker receives a COVID-19 diagnosis only if 
10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, their symptoms 
have improved, and the worker has had no fevers (without the use of 
fever reducing medications) for the last 72 hours. A worker without 
symptoms who was diagnosed with COVID-19 can return to work only 
if 10 days have passed since the date of the first positive COVID-19 
test. 
• To seek medical attention if their symptoms become severe, including 
persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, or bluish lips or face. 
Updates and further details are available on CDC’s webpage. 
• The importance of frequent handwashing with soap and water, 
including scrubbing with soap for 20 seconds (or using hand sanitizer 
with at least 60% ethanol (preferred) or 70% isopropanol (if the product 
is inaccessible to unsupervised children) when workers cannot get to a 
sink or handwashing station, per CDC guidelines). 
• The importance of physical distancing, both at work and off work time 
(see Physical Distancing section below). 
• Proper use of face coverings, including: 
o Face coverings do not protect the wearer and are not personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
o Face coverings can help protect people near the wearer, but do not 
replace the need for physical distancing and frequent handwashing. 
o Face coverings must cover the nose and mouth. 
o Workers should wash or sanitize hands before and after using or 
adjusting face coverings. 
o Avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. 
o Face coverings must not be shared and should be washed or discarded 
after each shift.

Coverings, which mandates the circumstances in which face coverings 
must be worn and the exemptions, as well as any policies, work rules, and 
practices the employer has adopted to ensure the use of face coverings. 
Training should also include the employer’s policies on how people who 
are exempted from wearing a face covering will be handled. 
• Ensure any independent contractors, temporary, or contract workers at 
the facility are also properly trained in COVID-19 prevention policies and 
have necessary supplies and PPE. Discuss these responsibilities ahead of 
time with organizations supplying temporary and/or contract workers. 
• Information on paid leave benefits the worker may be entitled to 
receive that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See 
additional information on government programs supporting sick leave 
and workers’ compensation for COVID-19, including workers’ sick leave 
rights under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and workers’ 
rights to workers’ compensation benefits and presumption of the work-
relatedness of COVID-19 pursuant to the Governor’s Executive Order N-
62-20 while that Order is still in effect. 
Individual Control Measures and Screening 
• Provide temperature and/or symptom screenings for all workers at the 
beginning of their shift and any vendors, contractors, or other workers 
entering the establishment. Make sure the temperature/symptom 
screener avoids close contact with workers to the extent possible. 
• If requiring self-screening at home, which is an appropriate alternative to 
providing it at the establishment, ensure that screening was performed 
prior to the worker leaving home for their shift and follows CDC guidelines, 
as described in the Topics for Worker Training section above. 
• Encourage workers who are sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 to 
stay home. 
• Employers must provide and ensure workers use all required protective 
equipment, including eye protection and gloves where necessary. 
• Employers should consider where disposable glove use may be helpful 
to supplement frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer; 
examples are for workers who are screening others for symptoms or 
handlingcommonly touched items 
• Non-workers entering the port facility should be restricted to only those 
classified as essential by management and they must complete a 
temperature and/or symptom screening before entering.

Cleaning and Disinfecting Protocols 
• Perform thorough cleaning on high traffic areas such as break rooms, 
lunch areas, and changing areas, and areas of ingress and egress 
including, stairways and stairwells, handrails, and elevator controls. 
Frequently disinfect commonly used surfaces, including tables, amenities, 
doorknobs, toilets, and handwashing facilities, etc. 
• Clean touchable surfaces between users or shifts, whichever is more 
frequent, including but not limited to working surfaces, radios, machinery, 
tools, equipment, shelves, storage rooms, handles, latches and locks, and 
controls on stationary and mobile equipment. 
• Require workers to wash hands or use sanitizer between use of shared 
equipment, such as time clocks and forklifts, and allow time to do so. 
Provide time for workers to implement cleaning practices during their shift. 
Cleaning assignments should be assigned during working hours as part of 
the worker’s job duties. 
• Avoid sharing phones, office supplies, other work tools, or equipment 
wherever possible. Never share PPE. 
• Ensure that sanitary facilities stay operational and stocked at all times and 
provide additional soap, paper towels, and hand sanitizer when needed. 
Provide additional sanitary facilities (portable toilets and handwashing 
stations) if necessary. 
• To minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated 
with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features are 
safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown. 
• Provide resources to promote workers’ personal hygiene. This will include 
tissues, no-touch trash cans, hand soap, adequate time for handwashing, 
alcohol-based hand sanitizers, disinfectants, and disposable towels. 
• When choosing disinfecting chemicals, employers should use products 
approved for use against COVID-19 on the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA)-approved list and follow product instructions. Use 
disinfectants labeled to be effective against emerging viral pathogens, 
diluted household bleach solutions (5 tablespoons per gallon of water), or 
alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol that are appropriate for the 
surface. Provide workers training on the chemical hazards, manufacturer’s 
directions, ventilation requirements, and Cal/OSHA requirements for safe 
use. Workers using cleaners or disinfectants should wear gloves and other 
protective equipment as required by the product instructions. Follow the 
asthma-safer cleaning methods recommended by the California 
Department of Public Health and ensure proper ventilation.

• Consider installing portable high-efficiency air cleaners, upgrading the 
facility’s air filters to the highest efficiency possible, and making other 
modifications to increase the quantity of outside air and ventilation in 
work and break areas. 
Physical Distancing Guidelines 
• Implement measures to ensure physical distancing of at least six feet 
between workers, including transportation personnel. This can include the 
use of physical partitions or visual cues such as floor markings, colored 
tape, or signs to indicate to where workers should stand. 
• Minimize transaction time between port workers, warehouse workers, 
and transportation personnel. Perform gate check-ins and paperwork 
digitally if feasible. Workers are strongly recommended to put on face 
coverings prior to interfacing with transportation personnel and other 
people entering and exiting the facility. 
• Require truck drivers and other non-workers at terminals to follow all 
COVID-19 related precautions. Provide visual cues in waiting and service 
areas. Provide signage outlining requirements in areas where workers or 
non-workers may be, which include pictographs or are in a language 
and language style they will understand. 
• Redesign workspaces and shared outdoor spaces to allow for at least six 
feet between workers. 
• Consider offering workers who request modified duties options that 
minimize their contact with other workers (e.g., managing 
administrative needs through telework). 
• Use the following hierarchy to prevent transmission of COVID-19 in work 
areas especially where physical distancing is difficult to maintain: 
engineering controls, administrative controls, and PPE. 
o Engineering controls include creating physical or spatial barriers 
between workers such as Plexiglas or other sturdy and 
impermeable partitions. 
o Administrative controls include increasing the number of shifts to 
reduce the number of personnel present at one time and ensure 
adequate physical distancing. 
o PPE includes face shields, some types of masks, and impermeable 
gloves. Note that some disposable equipment, such as respirators, 
are  prioritized  for  health  care  workers  and  workers  that  handle 
pathogens and should not otherwise be used.

• Adjust safety and other meetings to ensure physical distance and 
conduct smaller individual meetings at facilities to maintainphysical 
distancing guidelines. Wherever possible, transition all meetings and 
interviews to phone or digital platforms or hold outside. 
• Utilize work practices, when feasible, to limit the number of workers on-site 
at one time. This may include scheduling (e.g., staggering shift start/end 
times) or rotating crew access to a designated area during a shift. Stage 
the jobsite to stagger work and limit overlap of work crews. Discourage 
workers from congregating in high traffic areas. 
• Place additional limitations on the number of workers in enclosed areas, 
where six feet of separation may not be sufficient to limit transmission of 
the virus. 
• Stagger worker breaks, in compliance with wage and hour regulations, 
to maintain physical distancing protocols. 
• Close breakrooms, use barriers, or increase distance between 
tables/chairs to separate workers and discourage congregating 
during breaks. Where possible, create outdoor break areas with shade 
covers and seating that ensures physical distancing. 
• Hold port commission meetings virtually. 
• Suspend school and business boat tours and close other public access to 
the docks. Control pedestrian access at port facilities and promenades, 
and limit access to picnic tables, benches, and other amenities that 
may be placed on publicly-accessible port property. 
1Additional requirements must be considered for vulnerable populations. Ports must 
comply with all Cal/OSHA standards and be prepared to adhere to its guidance as well 
as guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the 
California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Additionally, employers must be 
prepared to alter their operations as those guidelines change.
